I wanted to answer a address a few things that a lot of people are saying: \n\n1. The reason we can‚Äôt just plant more trees/salt marshes/vegetation is that it‚Äôs not *durable*. We need carbon pulled out of the atmosphere to *stay* out of the atmosphere for a long time (at least a 1000 years is good, 10M years is better). Plants are remarkable carbon capture devices but release the carbon back into the atmosphere after a short time. The vast majority of biomass introduces a *lag* into the system but it doesn‚Äôt store the carbon. As someone else said, we can do both in tandem, but biological systems shouldn‚Äôt be relied on for long-term, durable storage. \n\n2. Yes, DAC is expensive but we, unfortunately, need to deploy it in very large quantities. Even if we were to stop emitting all GHGs at this very second we would still feel the effects of emitted GHGs already in our atmosphere for 50+ years. We need *negative emissions*, or ways to start pulling carbon out of the atmosphere and reduce the forcing. Currently, the ocean is the largest carbon sink by a very wide margin (IIRC, ~90%) but the more CO2 the ocean extracts the more acidic it becomes (which is no bueno). Therefore, we need a solution to pull CO2 out of the atmosphere and keep it out without relying on natural systems that are being overloaded. Finally, even the most conservative estimates now say that we *need* to deploy DAC.\n\n3. We are currently on the ‚Äúbleeding edge‚Äù of DAC technology development. Although people have been saying this since DAC was first hypothesized, the cost of DAC is expected to rapidly decline from $600-1000USD per ton stored to a lot less than that (I don‚Äôt know the estimated number but I think ~$200-300USD). The reason it‚Äôs so expensive to do DAC is high atmospheric CO2 (400ppm) is still very diffuse (~0.04% by volume). Deployment of actual capture facilities will hopefully help us optimize the process and reduce costs. This is different than previous decades because we‚Äôre actually deploying full size plants right now, not just lab bench or pilot projects. \n\nI‚Äôm happy to answer any other questions folks may have about carbon dioxide removal (DAC, CCS, etc), the climate crisis, etc.\n\nEdit: I appreciate the critiques and questions about DAC, and CDR in general. I'm not exactly pro-DAC but I am pragmatic about what's in our toolbox and where we need to get to hit climate targets.","author":"Atmos_Dan","score":0,"created":1699884992,"link_id":"t3_17u3u3g"},{"Id":"k92hsf8","Name":"t1_k92hsf8","body":"The folks at school drop off, that idle their giant SUVs with 7 liter engines will really appreciate this","author":"Fearless-Lion7574","score":0,"created":1699885021,"link_id":"t3_17u3u3g"},{"Id":"k91bjfv","Name":"t1_k91bjfv","body":"What climate change?

These sounds are then played back to a neural network, which is running on the smartphone; then certain sounds are boosted or suppressed in real time, depending on the user‚Äôs preferences. It was developed by researchers from the University of Washington, who presented the research at the ACM Symposium on User Interface Software and Technology (UIST) last week.\n\nThe team trained the network on thousands of audio samples from online data sets and sounds collected from various noisy environments. Then they taught it to recognize 20 everyday sounds, such as a thunderstorm, a toilet flushing, or glass breaking.\n\nIt was tested on nine participants, who wandered around offices, parks, and streets. The researchers found that their system performed well at muffling and boosting sounds, even in situations it hadn‚Äôt been trained for. However, it struggled slightly at separating human speech from background music, especially rap music.\n\nMimicking human ability\n\nResearchers have long tried to solve the ‚Äúcocktail party problem‚Äù‚Äîthat is, to get a computer to focus on a single voice in a crowded room, as humans are able to do. This new method represents a significant step forward and demonstrates the technology‚Äôs potential, says Marc Delcroix, a senior research scientist at NTT Communication Science Laboratories, Kyoto, who studies speech enhancement and recognition and was not involved in the project. \n\n‚ÄúThis kind of achievement is very helpful for the field,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúSimilar ideas have been around, especially in the field of speech separation, but they are the first to propose a complete real-time binaural target sound extraction system.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúNoise-canceling headsets today have this capability where you can still play music even when the noise canceling is turned on,‚Äù says Shyam Gollakota, an assistant professor at the University of Washington, who worked on the project. ‚ÄúInstead of playing music, we are playing back the actual sounds of interest from the environment, which we extracted from our machine-learning algorithms.‚Äù\n\nGollakota is excited by the technology‚Äôs potential for helping people with hearing loss, as hearing aids can be of limited use in noisy environments. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a unique opportunity to create the future of intelligent hearables through enhanced hearing,‚Äù he says.\n\nThe ability to be more selective about what we can and can‚Äôt hear could also benefit people who require focused listening for their job, such as health-care, military, and engineering professionals, or for factory or construction workers who want to protect their hearing while still being able to communicate.\n\nFiltering out the world\n\nThis type of system could for the first time give us a degree of control over the sounds that surround us‚Äîfor better or worse, says Mack Hagood, an associate professor of media and communication at Miami University in Ohio, and author of Hush: Media and Sonic Self-Control, who did not work on the project.\n\n‚ÄúThis is the dream‚ÄîI‚Äôve seen people fantasizing about this for a long time,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre basically getting to tick a box whether we want to hear those sounds or not, and there could be times where this narrowing of experience is really beneficial‚Äîsomething we really should do that might actually help promote better communication.‚Äù\n\nBut whenever we opt for control and choice, we‚Äôre pushing aside serendipity and happy accidents, he says. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre deciding in advance what we do and don‚Äôt want to hear,‚Äù he adds. ‚ÄúAnd that doesn‚Äôt give us the opportunity to know whether we really would have enjoyed hearing something.‚Äù","author":"kajikiwolfe","score":1,"created":1699566240,"link_id":"t3_17rdgo3"},{"Id":"k8kfj5v","Name":"t1_k8kfj5v","body":"I can finally know who farts on the airplane 14 seats away.

I wanted to answer a address a few things that a lot of people are saying: \n\n1. The reason we can‚Äôt just plant more trees/salt marshes/vegetation is that it‚Äôs not *durable*. We need carbon pulled out of the atmosphere to *stay* out of the atmosphere for a long time (at least a 1000 years is good, 10M years is better). Plants are remarkable carbon capture devices but release the carbon back into the atmosphere after a short time. The vast majority of biomass introduces a *lag* into the system but it doesn‚Äôt store the carbon. As someone else said, we can do both in tandem, but biological systems shouldn‚Äôt be relied on for long-term, durable storage. \n\n2. Yes, DAC is expensive but we, unfortunately, need to deploy it in very large quantities. Even if we were to stop emitting all GHGs at this very second we would still feel the effects of emitted GHGs already in our atmosphere for 50+ years. We need *negative emissions*, or ways to start pulling carbon out of the atmosphere and reduce the forcing. Currently, the ocean is the largest carbon sink by a very wide margin (IIRC, ~90%) but the more CO2 the ocean extracts the more acidic it becomes (which is no bueno). Therefore, we need a solution to pull CO2 out of the atmosphere and keep it out without relying on natural systems that are being overloaded. Finally, even the most conservative estimates now say that we *need* to deploy DAC.\n\n3. We are currently on the ‚Äúbleeding edge‚Äù of DAC technology development. Although people have been saying this since DAC was first hypothesized, the cost of DAC is expected to rapidly decline from $600-1000USD per ton stored to a lot less than that (I don‚Äôt know the estimated number but I think ~$200-300USD). The reason it‚Äôs so expensive to do DAC is high atmospheric CO2 (400ppm) is still very diffuse (~0.04% by volume). Deployment of actual capture facilities will hopefully help us optimize the process and reduce costs. This is different than previous decades because we‚Äôre actually deploying full size plants right now, not just lab bench or pilot projects. \n\nI‚Äôm happy to answer any other questions folks may have about carbon dioxide removal (DAC, CCS, etc), the climate crisis, etc.\n\nEdit: I appreciate the critiques and questions about DAC, and CDR in general. I'm not exactly pro-DAC but I am pragmatic about what's in our toolbox and where we need to get to hit climate targets.","author":"Atmos_Dan","score":0,"created":1699884992,"link_id":"t3_17u3u3g"},{"Id":"k92hsf8","Name":"t1_k92hsf8","body":"The folks at school drop off, that idle their giant SUVs with 7 liter engines will really appreciate this","author":"Fearless-Lion7574","score":0,"created":1699885021,"link_id":"t3_17u3u3g"},{"Id":"k91bjfv","Name":"t1_k91bjfv","body":"What climate change?

These sounds are then played back to a neural network, which is running on the smartphone; then certain sounds are boosted or suppressed in real time, depending on the user‚Äôs preferences. It was developed by researchers from the University of Washington, who presented the research at the ACM Symposium on User Interface Software and Technology (UIST) last week.\n\nThe team trained the network on thousands of audio samples from online data sets and sounds collected from various noisy environments. Then they taught it to recognize 20 everyday sounds, such as a thunderstorm, a toilet flushing, or glass breaking.\n\nIt was tested on nine participants, who wandered around offices, parks, and streets. The researchers found that their system performed well at muffling and boosting sounds, even in situations it hadn‚Äôt been trained for. However, it struggled slightly at separating human speech from background music, especially rap music.\n\nMimicking human ability\n\nResearchers have long tried to solve the ‚Äúcocktail party problem‚Äù‚Äîthat is, to get a computer to focus on a single voice in a crowded room, as humans are able to do. This new method represents a significant step forward and demonstrates the technology‚Äôs potential, says Marc Delcroix, a senior research scientist at NTT Communication Science Laboratories, Kyoto, who studies speech enhancement and recognition and was not involved in the project. \n\n‚ÄúThis kind of achievement is very helpful for the field,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúSimilar ideas have been around, especially in the field of speech separation, but they are the first to propose a complete real-time binaural target sound extraction system.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúNoise-canceling headsets today have this capability where you can still play music even when the noise canceling is turned on,‚Äù says Shyam Gollakota, an assistant professor at the University of Washington, who worked on the project. ‚ÄúInstead of playing music, we are playing back the actual sounds of interest from the environment, which we extracted from our machine-learning algorithms.‚Äù\n\nGollakota is excited by the technology‚Äôs potential for helping people with hearing loss, as hearing aids can be of limited use in noisy environments. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a unique opportunity to create the future of intelligent hearables through enhanced hearing,‚Äù he says.\n\nThe ability to be more selective about what we can and can‚Äôt hear could also benefit people who require focused listening for their job, such as health-care, military, and engineering professionals, or for factory or construction workers who want to protect their hearing while still being able to communicate.\n\nFiltering out the world\n\nThis type of system could for the first time give us a degree of control over the sounds that surround us‚Äîfor better or worse, says Mack Hagood, an associate professor of media and communication at Miami University in Ohio, and author of Hush: Media and Sonic Self-Control, who did not work on the project.\n\n‚ÄúThis is the dream‚ÄîI‚Äôve seen people fantasizing about this for a long time,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre basically getting to tick a box whether we want to hear those sounds or not, and there could be times where this narrowing of experience is really beneficial‚Äîsomething we really should do that might actually help promote better communication.‚Äù\n\nBut whenever we opt for control and choice, we‚Äôre pushing aside serendipity and happy accidents, he says. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre deciding in advance what we do and don‚Äôt want to hear,‚Äù he adds. ‚ÄúAnd that doesn‚Äôt give us the opportunity to know whether we really would have enjoyed hearing something.‚Äù","author":"kajikiwolfe","score":1,"created":1699566240,"link_id":"t3_17rdgo3"},{"Id":"k8kfj5v","Name":"t1_k8kfj5v","body":"I can finally know who farts on the airplane 14 seats away.

Dmca does protect ai generated content, so the basis of a takedown would (legally speaking) be because 1 party believes content appears to be close enough to their own that they call it a deepfake? titles/tags/description/etc may suggest otherwise. \n\nThe law at least in the United States is based off innocent until proven guilty. This means for example, if an AI voice strongly reassembles a well known artist, is there a legal basis for a takedown if that content has no mention of that artist in the title/description/tags/thumbnail/video/etc? \n\nThere is legal precedence for financial damages due to false takedowns, in which a scenario like this could be extremely likely. Kind of like the simple basis of the Ed Sheeran case, that only so many chords/etc exist, could that translate to only so many voices exist? It‚Äôs highly unlikely that a party that issued a takedown for this type of content would be able to provide enough evidence in court to prove that an ai voice is the SAME as an artist, instead of strongly resembling. There is also legal precedence in the case Midler v.

I'll leave info for people that care.\n\nThe US has been working on nuclear nonproliferation for about 3 decades. The idea was that if we stopped the tech from spreading and doing fewer bits of high enrichment, we wouldn't have an Iran type proliferation problem.\n\nWe spent decades taking fuel out of reactors with high enriched uranium and dropping to 5% or less across as many as possible. Some wouldn't be possible like I know the research reactor at a small college in Missouri would get too heavy for the design if it had to switch.\n\nBut under Obama there was a large push to pull HEU out of eastern European research reactors so terrorists couldn't try for dirty bombs.\n\nDefinitely good to have alternatives to Paducah that did HEU for DOE and the Navy (subs and carriers tended to use about 20% enriched) as that tech was OLD and expensive.\n\nReagan demanded the US skip the centrifuge tech and had eyes aglow with lasers and star wars. Alvis is STILL in pilot plant level (and I had thought it was on the verge of being scales up when I passed a room at the GE facility in 2007 I think!), so it's kinda sad it took so long to come back around to it.\n\nI don't know if it's a great idea to do high enrichment for new plant designs, but I'll hold judgement while they're designing them.\n\nThough they just canceled one of those proposed plants (which I called as going to fail when they announced it in 2020 as just not serious because of who/where it was).\n\nSo we'll see!","author":"showingoffstuff","score":27,"created":1699983485,"link_id":"t3_17v42ue"},{"Id":"k98qpck","Name":"t1_k98qpck","body":"Nuclear is the way too goo!!!!!

Dmca does protect ai generated content, so the basis of a takedown would (legally speaking) be because 1 party believes content appears to be close enough to their own that they call it a deepfake? titles/tags/description/etc may suggest otherwise. \n\nThe law at least in the United States is based off innocent until proven guilty. This means for example, if an AI voice strongly reassembles a well known artist, is there a legal basis for a takedown if that content has no mention of that artist in the title/description/tags/thumbnail/video/etc? \n\nThere is legal precedence for financial damages due to false takedowns, in which a scenario like this could be extremely likely. Kind of like the simple basis of the Ed Sheeran case, that only so many chords/etc exist, could that translate to only so many voices exist? It‚Äôs highly unlikely that a party that issued a takedown for this type of content would be able to provide enough evidence in court to prove that an ai voice is the SAME as an artist, instead of strongly resembling.

I'll leave info for people that care.\n\nThe US has been working on nuclear nonproliferation for about 3 decades. The idea was that if we stopped the tech from spreading and doing fewer bits of high enrichment, we wouldn't have an Iran type proliferation problem.\n\nWe spent decades taking fuel out of reactors with high enriched uranium and dropping to 5% or less across as many as possible. Some wouldn't be possible like I know the research reactor at a small college in Missouri would get too heavy for the design if it had to switch.\n\nBut under Obama there was a large push to pull HEU out of eastern European research reactors so terrorists couldn't try for dirty bombs.\n\nDefinitely good to have alternatives to Paducah that did HEU for DOE and the Navy (subs and carriers tended to use about 20% enriched) as that tech was OLD and expensive.\n\nReagan demanded the US skip the centrifuge tech and had eyes aglow with lasers and star wars. Alvis is STILL in pilot plant level (and I had thought it was on the verge of being scales up when I passed a room at the GE facility in 2007 I think!), so it's kinda sad it took so long to come back around to it.\n\nI don't know if it's a great idea to do high enrichment for new plant designs, but I'll hold judgement while they're designing them.\n\nThough they just canceled one of those proposed plants (which I called as going to fail when they announced it in 2020 as just not serious because of who/where it was).\n\nSo we'll see!","author":"showingoffstuff","score":29,"created":1699983485,"link_id":"t3_17v42ue"},{"Id":"k98qpck","Name":"t1_k98qpck","body":"Nuclear is the way too goo!!!!!

It can take up to 100 comment/post ids in one request to get their current state.\n\nYou can easily scale this up to even many subreddits by using multireddits like r/redditdev+requestabot for both the new and comments feeds. Just check those once a minute and unless all the subreddits put together get more than 100 comments a minute you won't miss anything.\n\nRechecking will depend on how often you want to recheck. You could likely easily do once an hour for all recent content without getting close to the limit. There is also a r/SUBREDDIT/about/edited/ feed which shows recently edited items for subreddit's you're a moderator of (though it has some limits).\n\nLastly you could ask to join r/devvit, reddit's new native bot platform, which does actually have event hooks for new and edited items.","author":"Watchful1","score":3,"created":1699746227,"link_id":"t3_17sqs2d"},{"Id":"k8sard1","Name":"t1_k8sard1","body":"I've considered tackling this problem, but I'm working on other tools in the meantime. Comments are definitely going to hit the API limit easily especially if a post is particularly popular and as the other comment mentioned, accounting for other factors such as deletions or edits.\n\nFor posts: Depending on the subreddit you're trying to monitor, you could set timers in the code to make API calls every N minutes. I'm not sure what your exact use case is, but I've found the Mod Queue to be particularly helpful for just checking for filtered or reports. If you're trying to build a backlog or history of all submitted posts to review, then I would definitely go the local database route and build your own UI that can display an X amount of posts every N minutes. This could be just a single API call using PRAW.\n\nFor comments: Comments needs posts to exist so I think you could build your own algorithm or system that would best suit your monitoring needs. For example, you could check for the three top voted posts in the past N minutes and then store the comments there. Since you mentioned comparing data, you could consider caching through Memcached or Redis for efficiency as well.\n\nI do recommend using PRAW as it helps rate limit the API calls, but for comments, it might be more accurate/reliable to make calls to Reddit's API directly.","author":"Aveldaheilt","score":2,"created":1699712067,"link_id":"t3_17sqs2d"},{"Id":"k8t4jb3","Name":"t1_k8t4jb3","body":"If it‚Äôs just one or a few subreddits this is easy.\n\nPoll every 5 minutes and check against database, like you said.

Comments are definitely going to hit the API limit easily especially if a post is particularly popular and as the other comment mentioned, accounting for other factors such as deletions or edits.\n\nFor posts: Depending on the subreddit you're trying to monitor, you could set timers in the code to make API calls every N minutes. I'm not sure what your exact use case is, but I've found the Mod Queue to be particularly helpful for just checking for filtered or reports. If you're trying to build a backlog or history of all submitted posts to review, then I would definitely go the local database route and build your own UI that can display an X amount of posts every N minutes. This could be just a single API call using PRAW.\n\nFor comments: Comments needs posts to exist so I think you could build your own algorithm or system that would best suit your monitoring needs. For example, you could check for the three top voted posts in the past N minutes and then store the comments there. Since you mentioned comparing data, you could consider caching through Memcached or Redis for efficiency as well.\n\nI do recommend using PRAW as it helps rate limit the API calls, but for comments, it might be more accurate/reliable to make calls to Reddit's API directly.","author":"Aveldaheilt","score":2,"created":1699712067,"link_id":"t3_17sqs2d"},{"Id":"k8t4jb3","Name":"t1_k8t4jb3","body":"If it‚Äôs just one or a few subreddits this is easy.\n\nPoll every 5 minutes and check against database, like you said.

Is there any real meaningful difference between Product vs Project vs Program Management?  \n4. Do I need to do LeetCode if I'm pursuing PM roles at tech companies? This is one of the things I dislike the most about the Software Engineering industry. Having to grind and study everytime I want to job hop is soul crushing.  \n5.

Currently working in Accounting  - trying to switch over to an PM. Prior to accounting I worked in TV development for 2 years and lead a team of 30+ people across 3 departments. No coding experience or knowledge but am considering going back to school for my MBA if it will help. Looking to move away from TV development and begin making the jump into an APM/PM role once my contract with current company ends. Advice on the next best move?\n\nHoping this is the right place to post, tried on some other subs but haven't had much engagement - I'm looking for any information on how to transition from a TV Dev/Accountant to a Product Manager.\n\nBACKGROUND / CONTEXT - I‚Äôm 23 years old. Graduated with a B.Sc. in Accounting in December 2022. During college I landed a job on a number of very popular traveling TV shows and eventually moved into TV development (bringing show ideas to life) where I led a team of 30+ people across 3 departments. Essentially, I was a PM but for a television show. For the past two years, my life has consisted of going to school for half of the year, and developing/working on television during the other half.\n\nWhen the strike hit, I decided to pick up a temporary job as a contracted accountant helping a company tie out their books for the end of the year. My original plan was to return to developing television shows once the contract ends, but I was recently encouraged to look into the Product Management career path by one of my mentors who has experience in the tech field.\n\nUpon looking into the role, making the switch while I‚Äôm still young seems like a no brainer. TV development isn‚Äôt nearly as secure or lucrative of a career, and quite frankly I‚Äôve felt that my business acumen has been going to waste in the field. Accounting is also not something I see myself in long term as it‚Äôs not creative, very objective, and involves lot of solo projects without team collaboration. I‚Äôm already very well-read/interested/curious about the tech field as a whole, I thrive in collaborative team-driven environments, I could essentially continue doing what I love (bringing a product from A-B), and increase my salary by almost 3x ‚Äî all signs point to this being a good transition to make while I‚Äôm wrapping up my current contract.\n\nWhich brings me to now. I don‚Äôt know the first thing about coding, so I‚Äôm looking for advice on how to proceed. What principles do I need to study to make this work? Would it help to go back to school? Do I need to complete a bootcamp or get certifications? How will I know if I‚Äôm ready to start applying for positions? And when I am, which kind of positions should I be applying for, and at what size company? I know it‚Äôs a handful of questions, but any general guidance would be greatly appreciated. I‚Äôm aware it won‚Äôt be easy, but I‚Äôm willing and able to take the time required to make this transition work.\n\nSide note ‚Äî while going through this shift I‚Äôve also been considering going back to school to get my MBA, but I‚Äôve heard some conflicting opinions on whether it‚Äôs a good idea for getting into Product Management. Some say it doesn‚Äôt matter and it‚Äôs better to get straight into the field however you can, but I‚Äôve also read [well-supported posts like this (on this sub)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ProductManagement/comments/uf1ulz/how_do_you_get_a_product_management_position/) that indicate that an MBA program could directly help you get into an APM program.

It would be a one year contract with a potential to convert to permanent. \n\n  \nThey're asking what my hourly rate would be and will consider me based on that? Kind of weird right? Shouldn't you have a rate in mind and select me based on skill and experience? What if they go off rate and choose someone really cheap but bad? Man, the state of the economy?\n\n  \nAnyways, how would you determine your hourly rate? Let's say I want to make something similar to $150k annually. I got an answer from chatGPT but wanted to get thoughts from people who have done a long term PM contract role.\n\n  \nOther questions include; what do you do when you need to go on vacation? Since you're paid hourly, do you actually clock in and clock out or do you work the normal 40-60 hours/week as a PM?\n\n  \nChatGPT response: (tldr: $120. Does this seem high or low? Seems a bit high to me)\n\n  \nCertainly, let's calculate the hourly rate for a target annual income of $150,000 as a contractor. We'll use the same approach as before, taking into account expenses and non-billable hours.  \n1. Calculate Your Annual Target Income:  \n \\- Your annual target income is $150,000.  \n1. Consider Additional Expenses:  \n \\- Consider any additional expenses you'll incur as a contractor, such as healthcare, retirement contributions, self-employment taxes, and other benefits your previous employer provided. For this example, let's estimate these expenses at $20,000.  \n\n\n1. Account for Business Overheads:  \n \\- Include business-related expenses like accounting, legal, and software tools. Let's estimate these costs at $5,000.  \n\n\n1. Determine the Number of Billable Hours:  \n \\- Assume that 70% of your working hours are billable. If you plan to work a full-time equivalent of 40 hours a week for 52 weeks a year, that's 2,080 hours in a year.  \n\n\n1. Calculate the Hourly Rate:  \n \\- Divide your annual target income (including expenses and business overheads) by the estimated number of billable hours in a year to calculate your hourly rate.  \n\n\nNow, let's calculate the hourly rate:  \n\\- Annual target income (including expenses): $150,000 + $20,000 + $5,000 = $175,000  \n\\- Estimated billable hours (70% of a 40-hour workweek for 52 weeks): 1,456 hours  \n\n\nHourly Rate = Total Target Income / Estimated Billable Hours Hourly Rate = $175,000 / 1,456 hours Hourly Rate ‚âà $120.09 per hour\n\n  \nSo, to achieve an annual income of $150,000 while accounting for additional expenses and business overheads, you would need to charge approximately $120 per hour as a contractor. This hourly rate can be adjusted based on your specific circumstances and market conditions.","author":"whabam1","score":1,"created":1697825601,"link_id":"t3_16jlqhw"},{"Id":"k5psm4n","Name":"t1_k5psm4n","body":"I am currently working as a Solutions Architect at a small consultancy after teaching high school English for ten years. \n\nRight now, I own the post-sales end-to-end experience for a specific pipeline of clients to: demo our partner software tools to executives and end users, complete a thorough requirements gathering with cross-departmental stakeholders, map out a detailed development and launch strategy, build the required workflow processes based on industry best practices and personal expertise (including any required integration with outside tools), and provide individualized team training as appropriate. \n\nI‚Äôve always been a builder, and I want to transition my career into product development.

I led our team through a difficult and critical project after my manager left in September of '22.

Gather feedback regularly and incorporate it into your product development.\n\n2. **Agile Development**: Implement agile methodologies to allow for quick adaptation to market changes and customer feedback. This also encourages collaboration and flexibility within the team.\n\n3. **Data-Driven Decision Making**: Use data analytics to make informed decisions. This includes tracking user engagement, churn rates, and other vital metrics to understand the product's performance and areas for improvement.\n\n4. **Cross-Functional Collaboration**: Encourage collaboration between different departments such as sales, marketing, customer support, and engineering. This ensures a unified approach to product development and marketing.\n\n5. **Continuous Innovation**: Always be on the lookout for new technologies and trends that can enhance your product. Continuous innovation keeps the product relevant and competitive.\n\n6. **User Experience (UX) Focus**: Invest in designing a user-friendly interface. A good UX can significantly impact customer satisfaction and retention.\n\n7. **Scalability and Reliability**: Ensure that your product can scale with increasing demand without compromising on performance or reliability.\n\n8. **Effective Roadmap Planning**: Have a clear product roadmap that outlines future features, improvements, and strategic direction. This helps in setting clear expectations and aligning the team's efforts.\n\n9. **Talent Development**: Invest in your team's professional development. Skilled and motivated employees are more likely to innovate and drive the product's success.\n\n10. **Compliance and Security**: Given the nature of SaaS products, maintaining high standards of data security and compliance with regulations is vital to protect your customers and your company's reputation.\n\nBy focusing on these areas, a SaaS company can build a product organization that is not only effective in the short term but also sustainable and adaptable for future growth and challenges.","author":"Sharknest","score":0,"created":1700096865,"link_id":"t3_17w1sq7"},{"Id":"k9lazxw","Name":"t1_k9lazxw","body":"In addition to my tagging a post suggestion as \"the way\"....

Currently working in Accounting  - trying to switch over to an PM. Prior to accounting I worked in TV development for 2 years and lead a team of 30+ people across 3 departments. No coding experience or knowledge but am considering going back to school for my MBA if it will help. Looking to move away from TV development and begin making the jump into an APM/PM role once my contract with current company ends. Advice on the next best move?\n\nHoping this is the right place to post, tried on some other subs but haven't had much engagement - I'm looking for any information on how to transition from a TV Dev/Accountant to a Product Manager.\n\nBACKGROUND / CONTEXT - I‚Äôm 23 years old. Graduated with a B.Sc. in Accounting in December 2022. During college I landed a job on a number of very popular traveling TV shows and eventually moved into TV development (bringing show ideas to life) where I led a team of 30+ people across 3 departments. Essentially, I was a PM but for a television show. For the past two years, my life has consisted of going to school for half of the year, and developing/working on television during the other half.\n\nWhen the strike hit, I decided to pick up a temporary job as a contracted accountant helping a company tie out their books for the end of the year. My original plan was to return to developing television shows once the contract ends, but I was recently encouraged to look into the Product Management career path by one of my mentors who has experience in the tech field.\n\nUpon looking into the role, making the switch while I‚Äôm still young seems like a no brainer. TV development isn‚Äôt nearly as secure or lucrative of a career, and quite frankly I‚Äôve felt that my business acumen has been going to waste in the field. Accounting is also not something I see myself in long term as it‚Äôs not creative, very objective, and involves lot of solo projects without team collaboration. I‚Äôm already very well-read/interested/curious about the tech field as a whole, I thrive in collaborative team-driven environments, I could essentially continue doing what I love (bringing a product from A-B), and increase my salary by almost 3x ‚Äî all signs point to this being a good transition to make while I‚Äôm wrapping up my current contract.\n\nWhich brings me to now. I don‚Äôt know the first thing about coding, so I‚Äôm looking for advice on how to proceed. What principles do I need to study to make this work? Would it help to go back to school? Do I need to complete a bootcamp or get certifications? How will I know if I‚Äôm ready to start applying for positions? And when I am, which kind of positions should I be applying for, and at what size company? I know it‚Äôs a handful of questions, but any general guidance would be greatly appreciated. I‚Äôm aware it won‚Äôt be easy, but I‚Äôm willing and able to take the time required to make this transition work.\n\nSide note ‚Äî while going through this shift I‚Äôve also been considering going back to school to get my MBA, but I‚Äôve heard some conflicting opinions on whether it‚Äôs a good idea for getting into Product Management. Some say it doesn‚Äôt matter and it‚Äôs better to get straight into the field however you can, but I‚Äôve also read [well-supported posts like this (on this sub)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ProductManagement/comments/uf1ulz/how_do_you_get_a_product_management_position/) that indicate that an MBA program could directly help you get into an APM program.

It would be a one year contract with a potential to convert to permanent. \n\n  \nThey're asking what my hourly rate would be and will consider me based on that? Kind of weird right? Shouldn't you have a rate in mind and select me based on skill and experience? What if they go off rate and choose someone really cheap but bad? Man, the state of the economy?\n\n  \nAnyways, how would you determine your hourly rate? Let's say I want to make something similar to $150k annually. I got an answer from chatGPT but wanted to get thoughts from people who have done a long term PM contract role.\n\n  \nOther questions include; what do you do when you need to go on vacation? Since you're paid hourly, do you actually clock in and clock out or do you work the normal 40-60 hours/week as a PM?\n\n  \nChatGPT response: (tldr: $120. Does this seem high or low? Seems a bit high to me)\n\n  \nCertainly, let's calculate the hourly rate for a target annual income of $150,000 as a contractor. We'll use the same approach as before, taking into account expenses and non-billable hours.  \n1. Calculate Your Annual Target Income:  \n \\- Your annual target income is $150,000.  \n1. Consider Additional Expenses:  \n \\- Consider any additional expenses you'll incur as a contractor, such as healthcare, retirement contributions, self-employment taxes, and other benefits your previous employer provided. For this example, let's estimate these expenses at $20,000.  \n\n\n1. Account for Business Overheads:  \n \\- Include business-related expenses like accounting, legal, and software tools. Let's estimate these costs at $5,000.  \n\n\n1. Determine the Number of Billable Hours:  \n \\- Assume that 70% of your working hours are billable. If you plan to work a full-time equivalent of 40 hours a week for 52 weeks a year, that's 2,080 hours in a year.  \n\n\n1. Calculate the Hourly Rate:  \n \\- Divide your annual target income (including expenses and business overheads) by the estimated number of billable hours in a year to calculate your hourly rate.  \n\n\nNow, let's calculate the hourly rate:  \n\\- Annual target income (including expenses): $150,000 + $20,000 + $5,000 = $175,000  \n\\- Estimated billable hours (70% of a 40-hour workweek for 52 weeks): 1,456 hours  \n\n\nHourly Rate = Total Target Income / Estimated Billable Hours Hourly Rate = $175,000 / 1,456 hours Hourly Rate ‚âà $120.09 per hour\n\n  \nSo, to achieve an annual income of $150,000 while accounting for additional expenses and business overheads, you would need to charge approximately $120 per hour as a contractor. This hourly rate can be adjusted based on your specific circumstances and market conditions.","author":"whabam1","score":1,"created":1697825601,"link_id":"t3_16jlqhw"},{"Id":"k5psm4n","Name":"t1_k5psm4n","body":"I am currently working as a Solutions Architect at a small consultancy after teaching high school English for ten years. \n\nRight now, I own the post-sales end-to-end experience for a specific pipeline of clients to: demo our partner software tools to executives and end users, complete a thorough requirements gathering with cross-departmental stakeholders, map out a detailed development and launch strategy, build the required workflow processes based on industry best practices and personal expertise (including any required integration with outside tools), and provide individualized team training as appropriate. \n\nI‚Äôve always been a builder, and I want to transition my career into product development.

Gather feedback regularly and incorporate it into your product development.\n\n2. **Agile Development**: Implement agile methodologies to allow for quick adaptation to market changes and customer feedback. This also encourages collaboration and flexibility within the team.\n\n3. **Data-Driven Decision Making**: Use data analytics to make informed decisions. This includes tracking user engagement, churn rates, and other vital metrics to understand the product's performance and areas for improvement.\n\n4. **Cross-Functional Collaboration**: Encourage collaboration between different departments such as sales, marketing, customer support, and engineering. This ensures a unified approach to product development and marketing.\n\n5. **Continuous Innovation**: Always be on the lookout for new technologies and trends that can enhance your product. Continuous innovation keeps the product relevant and competitive.\n\n6. **User Experience (UX) Focus**: Invest in designing a user-friendly interface. A good UX can significantly impact customer satisfaction and retention.\n\n7. **Scalability and Reliability**: Ensure that your product can scale with increasing demand without compromising on performance or reliability.\n\n8. **Effective Roadmap Planning**: Have a clear product roadmap that outlines future features, improvements, and strategic direction. This helps in setting clear expectations and aligning the team's efforts.\n\n9. **Talent Development**: Invest in your team's professional development. Skilled and motivated employees are more likely to innovate and drive the product's success.\n\n10. **Compliance and Security**: Given the nature of SaaS products, maintaining high standards of data security and compliance with regulations is vital to protect your customers and your company's reputation.\n\nBy focusing on these areas, a SaaS company can build a product organization that is not only effective in the short term but also sustainable and adaptable for future growth and challenges.","author":"Sharknest","score":0,"created":1700096865,"link_id":"t3_17w1sq7"},{"Id":"k9lazxw","Name":"t1_k9lazxw","body":"In addition to my tagging a post suggestion as \"the way\"....

Presenting in front of large groups helps you to improve that skillset very quickly because you're really putting it on the line.
