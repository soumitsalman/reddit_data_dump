For me the takeaway lesson of Covid is this. Humans are no match for a respiratory virus. No amount of public health or research into vaccines / treatments will be enough, because most people get to decide on their own whether to spread the virus. There are geneslly no consequences. In early 2020 I watched people keep on going to mass gathering parties and refuse masks. I watched bars and restaurants refuse to close or mitigate because they wanted to make money instead. These people are downstream responsible for thousands of deaths that their actions ultimately and predictably caused. None got so much as a $20 fine. No one cares, and no one talks about how we let hundreds of thousands of people die because we decided it was acceptable to do so. No scientific discovery will change human nature enough to beat this type of virus.\n","author":"Madmandocv1","score":32,"created":1700437072,"link_id":"t3_17z9bt7","permalink":"www.reddit.com/r/tech/comments/17z9bt7/how_tiny_hinges_bend_the_infectionspreading/k9yamy0/"},{"id":"k9yakp5","name":"t1_k9yakp5","body_html":"Very interesting discovery and nicely written article.

Sorry it’s not formatted more clearly or more succinct! —-\nHaving done this, my first suggestion is to figure out where are the biggest fires, where are they feeling pressure (internally and externally) to get something done, why did they hire a PM and think they need one?\nBe prepared to wear lots of hats and commit to outcomes not a job description. You’ll enjoy your job more and if you’re with a good team they’ll be great to work with. It’s just the nature of a startup and if you have good talent and good culture you’ll operate much faster when you’re positioning people to do what they’re best at - sometimes this means youre not the visionary - in fact it’s a red flag if the CEO/CTO stop wanting to influence product heavily. The product is the business and when an early stage founder steps back too early the business can suffer.\nThey do have to make sure they aren’t micromanaging, but it’s empowering to have their buy-in and frankly if one of the cofounders isn’t strategic and strong in vision, the startup will fail anyhow. They can’t both just be operators/executor’s. And they can’t put the weight of vision on a non-founder.\nBesides getting to know the strategic priorities and problems they’re hoping you solve, use the weapon of your time to become an expert on the customer. Up till now people have been all over the place and no one has had the time to talk with customers. They’ve been busy pitching investors, selling customers, building the foundation, etc. - frankly they probably know where there are problems, but don’t actually know problems in-depth yet.\nAlong with building expertise in customers, build your next level of influence by building relationships with people in the org. Many startups face disconnects between sales/marketing and product. Be that bridge.\nFinally, if you’re looking for a problem to solve and guide your efforts, the easiest way is to take a look at the funnel and customer journey.\nWhat’s the state of the product? All the way from awareness, capture and closing to retention and promotion. Now figure out why. \nThe sooner you can do this the sooner you can build impact on the org. It’s the easiest way to start and guide your efforts. My other tip is search for the “Aha moment”. What’s the moment that it all clicks for the customer when they’re on the journey. Where they see the value and the implications of the product. How can you help move that to the front. If it doesn’t exist yet, you don’t have enough user value today and you need to build and build. (If you don’t have it yet, usually a bit early to get a PM imo because priority in resources should be building off gut and small feedback loops until you get that value, but you can still succeed if they haven’t found it).\n","author":"LearnQuick","score":11,"created":1700418139,"link_id":"t3_17z1nn3","permalink":"www.reddit.com/r/ProductManagement/comments/17z1nn3/first_pm/k9x0cn1/"},{"id":"k9wtkzw","name":"t1_k9wtkzw","body_html":"I just quit after being the first product person, so same situation.

However, the criteria the insurance company uses may say that based on the data they have collected, the average person only needs 6 weeks of PT or 12 total visits. Therefore they will only approve up to 12. Of course every person is different and some may only need 12 visits but some may need 24 or 36 or whatever. It really shouldn’t be denied off the bat.

Therefore they will only approve up to 12. Of course every person is different and some may only need 12 visits but some may need 24 or 36 or whatever. It really shouldn’t be denied off the bat.

Hopefully you can find the value in here even if it’s just one sentence. Sorry it’s not formatted more clearly or more succinct! —-\nHaving done this, my first suggestion is to figure out where are the biggest fires, where are they feeling pressure (internally and externally) to get something done, why did they hire a PM and think they need one?\nBe prepared to wear lots of hats and commit to outcomes not a job description. You’ll enjoy your job more and if you’re with a good team they’ll be great to work with. It’s just the nature of a startup and if you have good talent and good culture you’ll operate much faster when you’re positioning people to do what they’re best at - sometimes this means youre not the visionary - in fact it’s a red flag if the CEO/CTO stop wanting to influence product heavily. The product is the business and when an early stage founder steps back too early the business can suffer.\nThey do have to make sure they aren’t micromanaging, but it’s empowering to have their buy-in and frankly if one of the cofounders isn’t strategic and strong in vision, the startup will fail anyhow. They can’t both just be operators/executor’s. And they can’t put the weight of vision on a non-founder.\nBesides getting to know the strategic priorities and problems they’re hoping you solve, use the weapon of your time to become an expert on the customer. Up till now people have been all over the place and no one has had the time to talk with customers. They’ve been busy pitching investors, selling customers, building the foundation, etc. - frankly they probably know where there are problems, but don’t actually know problems in-depth yet.\nAlong with building expertise in customers, build your next level of influence by building relationships with people in the org. Many startups face disconnects between sales/marketing and product. Be that bridge.\nFinally, if you’re looking for a problem to solve and guide your efforts, the easiest way is to take a look at the funnel and customer journey.\nWhat’s the state of the product? All the way from awareness, capture and closing to retention and promotion. Now figure out why. \nThe sooner you can do this the sooner you can build impact on the org. It’s the easiest way to start and guide your efforts. My other tip is search for the “Aha moment”. What’s the moment that it all clicks for the customer when they’re on the journey. Where they see the value and the implications of the product. How can you help move that to the front. If it doesn’t exist yet, you don’t have enough user value today and you need to build and build. (If you don’t have it yet, usually a bit early to get a PM imo because priority in resources should be building off gut and small feedback loops until you get that value, but you can still succeed if they haven’t found it).\n","author":"LearnQuick","score":11,"created":1700418139,"link_id":"t3_17z1nn3","permalink":"www.reddit.com/r/ProductManagement/comments/17z1nn3/first_pm/k9x0cn1/"},{"id":"k9wtkzw","name":"t1_k9wtkzw","body_html":"I just quit after being the first product person, so same situation.

Hopefully you can find the value in here even if it’s just one sentence. Sorry it’s not formatted more clearly or more succinct! —-\nHaving done this, my first suggestion is to figure out where are the biggest fires, where are they feeling pressure (internally and externally) to get something done, why did they hire a PM and think they need one?\nBe prepared to wear lots of hats and commit to outcomes not a job description. You’ll enjoy your job more and if you’re with a good team they’ll be great to work with. It’s just the nature of a startup and if you have good talent and good culture you’ll operate much faster when you’re positioning people to do what they’re best at - sometimes this means youre not the visionary - in fact it’s a red flag if the CEO/CTO stop wanting to influence product heavily. The product is the business and when an early stage founder steps back too early the business can suffer.\nThey do have to make sure they aren’t micromanaging, but it’s empowering to have their buy-in and frankly if one of the cofounders isn’t strategic and strong in vision, the startup will fail anyhow. They can’t both just be operators/executor’s. And they can’t put the weight of vision on a non-founder.\nBesides getting to know the strategic priorities and problems they’re hoping you solve, use the weapon of your time to become an expert on the customer. Up till now people have been all over the place and no one has had the time to talk with customers. They’ve been busy pitching investors, selling customers, building the foundation, etc. - frankly they probably know where there are problems, but don’t actually know problems in-depth yet.\nAlong with building expertise in customers, build your next level of influence by building relationships with people in the org. Many startups face disconnects between sales/marketing and product. Be that bridge.\nFinally, if you’re looking for a problem to solve and guide your efforts, the easiest way is to take a look at the funnel and customer journey.\nWhat’s the state of the product? All the way from awareness, capture and closing to retention and promotion. Now figure out why. \nThe sooner you can do this the sooner you can build impact on the org. It’s the easiest way to start and guide your efforts. My other tip is search for the “Aha moment”. What’s the moment that it all clicks for the customer when they’re on the journey. Where they see the value and the implications of the product. How can you help move that to the front. If it doesn’t exist yet, you don’t have enough user value today and you need to build and build. (If you don’t have it yet, usually a bit early to get a PM imo because priority in resources should be building off gut and small feedback loops until you get that value, but you can still succeed if they haven’t found it).\n","author":"LearnQuick","score":12,"created":1700418139,"link_id":"t3_17z1nn3","permalink":"www.reddit.com/r/ProductManagement/comments/17z1nn3/first_pm/k9x0cn1/"},{"id":"k9wtkzw","name":"t1_k9wtkzw","body_html":"I just quit after being the first product person, so same situation.

Basically if a person has a major surgery and they require skilled therapy (PT, OT, speech) or even a skilled nursing facility, the criteria we use will tell us what the average (median) utilization rate or visit count is for the specific procedure they have done. And this data is gathered from (supposedly) thousands/millions of cases nationwide.\nFor instance, say a person has a total knee replacement and will require physical therapy afterwards. The surgeon may order 12 weeks/24 visits of physical therapy. However, the criteria the insurance company uses may say that based on the data they have collected, the average person only needs 6 weeks of PT or 12 total visits. Therefore they will only approve up to 12. Of course every person is different and some may only need 12 visits but some may need 24 or 36 or whatever. It really shouldn’t be denied off the bat.

In early 2020 I watched people keep on going to mass gathering parties and refuse masks. I watched bars and restaurants refuse to close or mitigate because they wanted to make money instead. These people are downstream responsible for thousands of deaths that their actions ultimately and predictably caused. None got so much as a $20 fine.

I wanted to answer a address a few things that a lot of people are saying: \nThe reason we can’t just plant more trees/salt marshes/vegetation is that it’s not durable. We need carbon pulled out of the atmosphere to stay out of the atmosphere for a long time (at least a 1000 years is good, 10M years is better). Plants are remarkable carbon capture devices but release the carbon back into the atmosphere after a short time. The vast majority of biomass introduces a lag into the system but it doesn’t store the carbon. As someone else said, we can do both in tandem, but biological systems shouldn’t be relied on for long-term, durable storage. \nYes, DAC is expensive but we, unfortunately, need to deploy it in very large quantities. Even if we were to stop emitting all GHGs at this very second we would still feel the effects of emitted GHGs already in our atmosphere for 50+ years. We need negative emissions, or ways to start pulling carbon out of the atmosphere and reduce the forcing. Currently, the ocean is the largest carbon sink by a very wide margin (IIRC, ~90%) but the more CO2 the ocean extracts the more acidic it becomes (which is no bueno). Therefore, we need a solution to pull CO2 out of the atmosphere and keep it out without relying on natural systems that are being overloaded. Finally, even the most conservative estimates now say that we need to deploy DAC.\nWe are currently on the “bleeding edge” of DAC technology development. Although people have been saying this since DAC was first hypothesized, the cost of DAC is expected to rapidly decline from $600-1000USD per ton stored to a lot less than that (I don’t know the estimated number but I think ~$200-300USD). The reason it’s so expensive to do DAC is high atmospheric CO2 (400ppm) is still very diffuse (~0.04% by volume). Deployment of actual capture facilities will hopefully help us optimize the process and reduce costs. This is different than previous decades because we’re actually deploying full size plants right now, not just lab bench or pilot projects. \nI’m happy to answer any other questions folks may have about carbon dioxide removal (DAC, CCS, etc), the climate crisis, etc.\nEdit: I appreciate the critiques and questions about DAC, and CDR in general. I'm not exactly pro-DAC but I am pragmatic about what's in our toolbox and where we need to get to hit climate targets.\n","author":"Atmos_Dan","score":0,"created":1699884992,"link_id":"t3_17u3u3g","permalink":"www.reddit.com/r/tech/comments/17u3u3g/us_hits_carbon_tech_milestone_with_first/k92hpxh/"},{"id":"k92hsf8","name":"t1_k92hsf8","body_html":"The folks at school drop off, that idle their giant SUVs with 7 liter engines will really appreciate this\n","author":"Fearless-Lion7574","score":0,"created":1699885021,"link_id":"t3_17u3u3g","permalink":"www.reddit.com/r/tech/comments/17u3u3g/us_hits_carbon_tech_milestone_with_first/k92hsf8/"},{"id":"k91bjfv","name":"t1_k91bjfv","body_html":"What climate change?

The panels, each measuring nearly a meter in height and nearly 4 meters in width, are just one of the ways Panasonic intends to enter the building-integrated photovoltaics (BIPV) business.\nSandwiching the perovskite between glass means that it can serve as a building’s actual facades and walls while also generating electricity for on-site use or export to the grid, says Yukihiro Kaneko, general manager of Panasonic’s Applied Materials and Technology Center. He adds that Panasonic can change the material’s level of transparency during the fabrication process, according to a customer’s requirements, which can make it suitable for use as windows.\n","author":"Sariel007","score":21,"created":1699751557,"link_id":"t3_17t8c69","permalink":"www.reddit.com/r/tech/comments/17t8c69/perovskite_solar_cells_double_as_windows_and/k8vb19i/"},{"id":"k8wzf1j","name":"t1_k8wzf1j","body_html":"This is coming again and again.

These sounds are then played back to a neural network, which is running on the smartphone; then certain sounds are boosted or suppressed in real time, depending on the user’s preferences. It was developed by researchers from the University of Washington, who presented the research at the ACM Symposium on User Interface Software and Technology (UIST) last week.\nThe team trained the network on thousands of audio samples from online data sets and sounds collected from various noisy environments. Then they taught it to recognize 20 everyday sounds, such as a thunderstorm, a toilet flushing, or glass breaking.\nIt was tested on nine participants, who wandered around offices, parks, and streets. The researchers found that their system performed well at muffling and boosting sounds, even in situations it hadn’t been trained for. However, it struggled slightly at separating human speech from background music, especially rap music.\nMimicking human ability\nResearchers have long tried to solve the “cocktail party problem”—that is, to get a computer to focus on a single voice in a crowded room, as humans are able to do. This new method represents a significant step forward and demonstrates the technology’s potential, says Marc Delcroix, a senior research scientist at NTT Communication Science Laboratories, Kyoto, who studies speech enhancement and recognition and was not involved in the project. \n“This kind of achievement is very helpful for the field,” he says. “Similar ideas have been around, especially in the field of speech separation, but they are the first to propose a complete real-time binaural target sound extraction system.”\n“Noise-canceling headsets today have this capability where you can still play music even when the noise canceling is turned on,” says Shyam Gollakota, an assistant professor at the University of Washington, who worked on the project. “Instead of playing music, we are playing back the actual sounds of interest from the environment, which we extracted from our machine-learning algorithms.”\nGollakota is excited by the technology’s potential for helping people with hearing loss, as hearing aids can be of limited use in noisy environments. “It’s a unique opportunity to create the future of intelligent hearables through enhanced hearing,” he says.\nThe ability to be more selective about what we can and can’t hear could also benefit people who require focused listening for their job, such as health-care, military, and engineering professionals, or for factory or construction workers who want to protect their hearing while still being able to communicate.\nFiltering out the world\nThis type of system could for the first time give us a degree of control over the sounds that surround us—for better or worse, says Mack Hagood, an associate professor of media and communication at Miami University in Ohio, and author of Hush: Media and Sonic Self-Control, who did not work on the project.\n“This is the dream—I’ve seen people fantasizing about this for a long time,” he says. “We’re basically getting to tick a box whether we want to hear those sounds or not, and there could be times where this narrowing of experience is really beneficial—something we really should do that might actually help promote better communication.”\nBut whenever we opt for control and choice, we’re pushing aside serendipity and happy accidents, he says. “We’re deciding in advance what we do and don’t want to hear,” he adds. “And that doesn’t give us the opportunity to know whether we really would have enjoyed hearing something.”\n","author":"kajikiwolfe","score":1,"created":1699566240,"link_id":"t3_17rdgo3","permalink":"www.reddit.com/r/tech/comments/17rdgo3/noisecanceling_headphones_could_let_you_pick_and/k8k6ap1/"},{"id":"k8kfj5v","name":"t1_k8kfj5v","body_html":"I can finally know who farts on the airplane 14 seats away.

I wanted to answer a address a few things that a lot of people are saying: \nThe reason we can’t just plant more trees/salt marshes/vegetation is that it’s not durable. We need carbon pulled out of the atmosphere to stay out of the atmosphere for a long time (at least a 1000 years is good, 10M years is better). Plants are remarkable carbon capture devices but release the carbon back into the atmosphere after a short time. The vast majority of biomass introduces a lag into the system but it doesn’t store the carbon. As someone else said, we can do both in tandem, but biological systems shouldn’t be relied on for long-term, durable storage. \nYes, DAC is expensive but we, unfortunately, need to deploy it in very large quantities. Even if we were to stop emitting all GHGs at this very second we would still feel the effects of emitted GHGs already in our atmosphere for 50+ years. We need negative emissions, or ways to start pulling carbon out of the atmosphere and reduce the forcing. Currently, the ocean is the largest carbon sink by a very wide margin (IIRC, ~90%) but the more CO2 the ocean extracts the more acidic it becomes (which is no bueno). Therefore, we need a solution to pull CO2 out of the atmosphere and keep it out without relying on natural systems that are being overloaded. Finally, even the most conservative estimates now say that we need to deploy DAC.\nWe are currently on the “bleeding edge” of DAC technology development. Although people have been saying this since DAC was first hypothesized, the cost of DAC is expected to rapidly decline from $600-1000USD per ton stored to a lot less than that (I don’t know the estimated number but I think ~$200-300USD). The reason it’s so expensive to do DAC is high atmospheric CO2 (400ppm) is still very diffuse (~0.04% by volume). Deployment of actual capture facilities will hopefully help us optimize the process and reduce costs. This is different than previous decades because we’re actually deploying full size plants right now, not just lab bench or pilot projects. \nI’m happy to answer any other questions folks may have about carbon dioxide removal (DAC, CCS, etc), the climate crisis, etc.\nEdit: I appreciate the critiques and questions about DAC, and CDR in general. I'm not exactly pro-DAC but I am pragmatic about what's in our toolbox and where we need to get to hit climate targets.\n","author":"Atmos_Dan","score":0,"created":1699884992,"link_id":"t3_17u3u3g","permalink":"www.reddit.com/r/tech/comments/17u3u3g/us_hits_carbon_tech_milestone_with_first/k92hpxh/"},{"id":"k92hsf8","name":"t1_k92hsf8","body_html":"The folks at school drop off, that idle their giant SUVs with 7 liter engines will really appreciate this\n","author":"Fearless-Lion7574","score":0,"created":1699885021,"link_id":"t3_17u3u3g","permalink":"www.reddit.com/r/tech/comments/17u3u3g/us_hits_carbon_tech_milestone_with_first/k92hsf8/"},{"id":"k91bjfv","name":"t1_k91bjfv","body_html":"What climate change?

These sounds are then played back to a neural network, which is running on the smartphone; then certain sounds are boosted or suppressed in real time, depending on the user’s preferences. It was developed by researchers from the University of Washington, who presented the research at the ACM Symposium on User Interface Software and Technology (UIST) last week.\nThe team trained the network on thousands of audio samples from online data sets and sounds collected from various noisy environments. Then they taught it to recognize 20 everyday sounds, such as a thunderstorm, a toilet flushing, or glass breaking.\nIt was tested on nine participants, who wandered around offices, parks, and streets. The researchers found that their system performed well at muffling and boosting sounds, even in situations it hadn’t been trained for. However, it struggled slightly at separating human speech from background music, especially rap music.\nMimicking human ability\nResearchers have long tried to solve the “cocktail party problem”—that is, to get a computer to focus on a single voice in a crowded room, as humans are able to do. This new method represents a significant step forward and demonstrates the technology’s potential, says Marc Delcroix, a senior research scientist at NTT Communication Science Laboratories, Kyoto, who studies speech enhancement and recognition and was not involved in the project. \n“This kind of achievement is very helpful for the field,” he says. “Similar ideas have been around, especially in the field of speech separation, but they are the first to propose a complete real-time binaural target sound extraction system.”\n“Noise-canceling headsets today have this capability where you can still play music even when the noise canceling is turned on,” says Shyam Gollakota, an assistant professor at the University of Washington, who worked on the project. “Instead of playing music, we are playing back the actual sounds of interest from the environment, which we extracted from our machine-learning algorithms.”\nGollakota is excited by the technology’s potential for helping people with hearing loss, as hearing aids can be of limited use in noisy environments. “It’s a unique opportunity to create the future of intelligent hearables through enhanced hearing,” he says.\nThe ability to be more selective about what we can and can’t hear could also benefit people who require focused listening for their job, such as health-care, military, and engineering professionals, or for factory or construction workers who want to protect their hearing while still being able to communicate.\nFiltering out the world\nThis type of system could for the first time give us a degree of control over the sounds that surround us—for better or worse, says Mack Hagood, an associate professor of media and communication at Miami University in Ohio, and author of Hush: Media and Sonic Self-Control, who did not work on the project.\n“This is the dream—I’ve seen people fantasizing about this for a long time,” he says. “We’re basically getting to tick a box whether we want to hear those sounds or not, and there could be times where this narrowing of experience is really beneficial—something we really should do that might actually help promote better communication.”\nBut whenever we opt for control and choice, we’re pushing aside serendipity and happy accidents, he says. “We’re deciding in advance what we do and don’t want to hear,” he adds. “And that doesn’t give us the opportunity to know whether we really would have enjoyed hearing something.”\n","author":"kajikiwolfe","score":1,"created":1699566240,"link_id":"t3_17rdgo3","permalink":"www.reddit.com/r/tech/comments/17rdgo3/noisecanceling_headphones_could_let_you_pick_and/k8k6ap1/"},{"id":"k8kfj5v","name":"t1_k8kfj5v","body_html":"I can finally know who farts on the airplane 14 seats away.

Basically if a person has a major surgery and they require skilled therapy (PT, OT, speech) or even a skilled nursing facility, the criteria we use will tell us what the average (median) utilization rate or visit count is for the specific procedure they have done. And this data is gathered from (supposedly) thousands/millions of cases nationwide.\nFor instance, say a person has a total knee replacement and will require physical therapy afterwards. The surgeon may order 12 weeks/24 visits of physical therapy. However, the criteria the insurance company uses may say that based on the data they have collected, the average person only needs 6 weeks of PT or 12 total visits. Therefore they will only approve up to 12. Of course every person is different and some may only need 12 visits but some may need 24 or 36 or whatever. It really shouldn’t be denied off the bat.

It's either lazy or intentional, and the software engineering in me says it's likely intentional.\n","author":"SparklySpencer","score":1,"created":1700336427,"link_id":"t3_17y6oqp","permalink":"www.reddit.com/r/technews/comments/17y6oqp/developers_cant_seem_to_stop_exposing_credentials/k9stdz6/"},{"id":"k9t0eka","name":"t1_k9t0eka","body_html":"Not sure how installing adobe air could lead to access to credentials.\n","author":"randothrowaway6600","score":1,"created":1700339499,"link_id":"t3_17y6oqp","permalink":"www.reddit.com/r/technews/comments/17y6oqp/developers_cant_seem_to_stop_exposing_credentials/k9t0eka/"},{"id":"k9t3snr","name":"t1_k9t3snr","body_html":"Setting it up properly takes time.\nPasting it into your source takes \u003c1 second.\n","author":"certainlyforgetful","score":1,"created":1700340982,"link_id":"t3_17y6oqp","permalink":"www.reddit.com/r/technews/comments/17y6oqp/developers_cant_seem_to_stop_exposing_credentials/k9t3snr/"},{"id":"k9tg5dt","name":"t1_k9tg5dt","body_html":"\\nervous laughter\\\nPfft, who-who does that?\n","author":"paladindan","score":1,"created":1700346555,"link_id":"t3_17y6oqp","permalink":"www.reddit.com/r/technews/comments/17y6oqp/developers_cant_seem_to_stop_exposing_credentials/k9tg5dt/"},{"id":"k9u1tt4","name":"t1_k9u1tt4","body_html":"Toyota had an extremely important key exposed for 5 years or so before anyone actually noticed\n","author":"mymar101","score":1,"created":1700356627,"link_id":"t3_17y6oqp","permalink":"www.reddit.com/r/technews/comments/17y6oqp/developers_cant_seem_to_stop_exposing_credentials/k9u1tt4/"},{"id":"k9ug1vn","name":"t1_k9ug1vn","body_html":"Lead dev here, incentivized for this not to be my teams top worry.\n","author":"skysetter","score":1,"created":1700363562,"link_id":"t3_17y6oqp","permalink":"www.reddit.com/r/technews/comments/17y6oqp/developers_cant_seem_to_stop_exposing_credentials/k9ug1vn/"},{"id":"k9uhcc8","name":"t1_k9uhcc8","body_html":"Deadlines don’t help with this\n","author":"timberwolf0122","score":1,"created":1700364197,"link_id":"t3_17y6oqp","permalink":"www.reddit.com/r/technews/comments/17y6oqp/developers_cant_seem_to_stop_exposing_credentials/k9uhcc8/"},{"id":"k9uq87x","name":"t1_k9uq87x","body_html":"fml\n“Exposing secrets in open-source packages carries significant risks for developers and users alike,” GitGuardian researchers wrote. “Attackers can exploit this information to gain unauthorized access, impersonate package maintainers, or manipulate users through social engineering tactics.”\n","author":"browntoe98","score":1,"created":1700368935,"link_id":"t3_17y6oqp","permalink":"www.reddit.com/r/technews/comments/17y6oqp/developers_cant_seem_to_stop_exposing_credentials/k9uq87x/"},{"id":"17yv86d","name":"t3_17yv86d","body_html":"","author":"donutloop","score":12,"created":1700393417,"link_id":"","permalink":"www.reddit.com/r/technews/comments/17yv86d/spacex_loses_contact_with_starship_rocket_in_new/"},{"id":"17yk4q4","name":"t3_17yk4q4","body_html":"","author":"wewewawa","score":78,"created":1700352783,"link_id":"","permalink":"www.reddit.com/r/technews/comments/17yk4q4/sorry_pat_but_its_looking_like_arm_pcs_are/"},{"id":"k9ttoe1","name":"t1_k9ttoe1","body_html":"Pat Gelsinger may not be worried about Arm-compatible PCs eating into Intel's profit margins, but, if recent history tells us anything, he probably should be.\nOn the x86 giant's Q3 earnings call on Thursday, Gelsinger assured investors that Arm PCs posed an \"insignificant\" threat. \"We take all our competition seriously, but I think history is our guide here. We don't see these as potentially being all that significant overall,\" he said of competing Arm-compatible products.\nWe're not sure what version of history Gelsinger is referring to, but many of us here at The Register can recall a time when x86 was far from the only choice when it came to PC architectures. It really wasn't until 2006, when Apple ditched PowerPC for Intel, that x86, or more specifically x86_64, really laid claim over the PC market.\nWho's to say history won't repeat itself this time, with Arm chipmakers putting pressure on Intel and AMD? There's an argument to be made that's already happening. Arm PCs aren't some nascent threat. Apple's M-series chips debuted almost three years ago and have repeatedly proven not only to be performance competitive with Intel and AMD processors, but usually quite a bit more efficient.\nThat last bit can't be understated, as performance is only one metric that has made Arm-compatible processors - like the M1 and M2 - so attractive. What good is performance if it kills your battery in the blink of an eye or puts a noticeable dent in your power bill?\nFor example, Apple's first-gen M1 MacBook Air — this vulture's daily driver at work — can still go toe to toe with Intel's latest-gen mobile chips in GeekBench 6, but routinely gets 12 hours of battery life and is passively cooled to boot.\nSay what you will about Apple's prices, business practices, operating system, ethics, or walled garden, the Cupertino's silicon is solid. Solid enough that Gelsinger himself reportedly sounded the alarm at Intel not long after announcing his return to the company as CEO in 2021.\n","author":"wewewawa","score":23,"created":1700352793,"link_id":"t3_17yk4q4","permalink":"www.reddit.com/r/technews/comments/17yk4q4/sorry_pat_but_its_looking_like_arm_pcs_are/k9ttoe1/"},{"id":"k9v0yi7","name":"t1_k9v0yi7","body_html":"He’s also the one who said that Intel hopes to win back Apple’s business in the future after Apple Silicon launched, right?\nThese statements make no sense, so who’s to say it’s not just posturing?\nAdmitting that ARM is an emerging architecture / a threat to Intel’s business would place scrutiny on Intel’s ARM offerings or lack thereof. \nIt’s possible that Intel is developing ARM chips, but putting out messaging downplaying the importance of ARM while they’re still behind.\nI don’t follow Intel, so this is complete speculation.\n","author":"acegikmo21767","score":3,"created":1700375940,"link_id":"t3_17yk4q4","permalink":"www.reddit.com/r/technews/comments/17yk4q4/sorry_pat_but_its_looking_like_arm_pcs_are/k9v0yi7/"},{"id":"k9vlc4m","name":"t1_k9vlc4m","body_html":"You know.

The surgeon may order 12 weeks/24 visits of physical therapy. However, the criteria the insurance company uses may say that based on the data they have collected, the average person only needs 6 weeks of PT or 12 total visits. Therefore they will only approve up to 12. Of course every person is different and some may only need 12 visits but some may need 24 or 36 or whatever. It really shouldn’t be denied off the bat.

Therefore they will only approve up to 12. Of course every person is different and some may only need 12 visits but some may need 24 or 36 or whatever. It really shouldn’t be denied off the bat.

We don't see these as potentially being all that significant overall,\" he said of competing Arm-compatible products.\nWe're not sure what version of history Gelsinger is referring to, but many of us here at The Register can recall a time when x86 was far from the only choice when it came to PC architectures. It really wasn't until 2006, when Apple ditched PowerPC for Intel, that x86, or more specifically x86_64, really laid claim over the PC market.\nWho's to say history won't repeat itself this time, with Arm chipmakers putting pressure on Intel and AMD? There's an argument to be made that's already happening. Arm PCs aren't some nascent threat. Apple's M-series chips debuted almost three years ago and have repeatedly proven not only to be performance competitive with Intel and AMD processors, but usually quite a bit more efficient.\nThat last bit can't be understated, as performance is only one metric that has made Arm-compatible processors - like the M1 and M2 - so attractive. What good is performance if it kills your battery in the blink of an eye or puts a noticeable dent in your power bill?\nFor example, Apple's first-gen M1 MacBook Air — this vulture's daily driver at work — can still go toe to toe with Intel's latest-gen mobile chips in GeekBench 6, but routinely gets 12 hours of battery life and is passively cooled to boot.\nSay what you will about Apple's prices, business practices, operating system, ethics, or walled garden, the Cupertino's silicon is solid. Solid enough that Gelsinger himself reportedly sounded the alarm at Intel not long after announcing his return to the company as CEO in 2021.\n","author":"wewewawa","score":22,"created":1700352793,"link_id":"t3_17yk4q4","permalink":"www.reddit.com/r/technews/comments/17yk4q4/sorry_pat_but_its_looking_like_arm_pcs_are/k9ttoe1/"},{"id":"k9v0yi7","name":"t1_k9v0yi7","body_html":"He’s also the one who said that Intel hopes to win back Apple’s business in the future after Apple Silicon launched, right?\nThese statements make no sense, so who’s to say it’s not just posturing?\nAdmitting that ARM is an emerging architecture / a threat to Intel’s business would place scrutiny on Intel’s ARM offerings or lack thereof. \nIt’s possible that Intel is developing ARM chips, but putting out messaging downplaying the importance of ARM while they’re still behind.\nI don’t follow Intel, so this is complete speculation.\n","author":"acegikmo21767","score":3,"created":1700375940,"link_id":"t3_17yk4q4","permalink":"www.reddit.com/r/technews/comments/17yk4q4/sorry_pat_but_its_looking_like_arm_pcs_are/k9v0yi7/"},{"id":"k9vlc4m","name":"t1_k9vlc4m","body_html":"You know.

But I do care about the scores of stuff, so I keep the timestamp the post/comment was created and 24 hours after I use the /api/info endpoint to look them up again. It can take up to 100 comment/post ids in one request to get their current state.\nYou can easily scale this up to even many subreddits by using multireddits like r/redditdev+requestabot for both the new and comments feeds. Just check those once a minute and unless all the subreddits put together get more than 100 comments a minute you won't miss anything.\nRechecking will depend on how often you want to recheck. You could likely easily do once an hour for all recent content without getting close to the limit. There is also a r/SUBREDDIT/about/edited/ feed which shows recently edited items for subreddit's you're a moderator of (though it has some limits).\nLastly you could ask to join r/devvit, reddit's new native bot platform, which does actually have event hooks for new and edited items.\n","author":"Watchful1","score":3,"created":1699746227,"link_id":"t3_17sqs2d","permalink":"www.reddit.com/r/redditdev/comments/17sqs2d/building_bots_whats_the_best_way_to_monitor_a/k8uxugq/"},{"id":"k8sard1","name":"t1_k8sard1","body_html":"I've considered tackling this problem, but I'm working on other tools in the meantime. Comments are definitely going to hit the API limit easily especially if a post is particularly popular and as the other comment mentioned, accounting for other factors such as deletions or edits.\nFor posts: Depending on the subreddit you're trying to monitor, you could set timers in the code to make API calls every N minutes. I'm not sure what your exact use case is, but I've found the Mod Queue to be particularly helpful for just checking for filtered or reports. If you're trying to build a backlog or history of all submitted posts to review, then I would definitely go the local database route and build your own UI that can display an X amount of posts every N minutes. This could be just a single API call using PRAW.\nFor comments: Comments needs posts to exist so I think you could build your own algorithm or system that would best suit your monitoring needs. For example, you could check for the three top voted posts in the past N minutes and then store the comments there. Since you mentioned comparing data, you could consider caching through Memcached or Redis for efficiency as well.\nI do recommend using PRAW as it helps rate limit the API calls, but for comments, it might be more accurate/reliable to make calls to Reddit's API directly.\n","author":"Aveldaheilt","score":2,"created":1699712067,"link_id":"t3_17sqs2d","permalink":"www.reddit.com/r/redditdev/comments/17sqs2d/building_bots_whats_the_best_way_to_monitor_a/k8sard1/"},{"id":"k8t4jb3","name":"t1_k8t4jb3","body_html":"If it’s just one or a few subreddits this is easy.\nPoll every 5 minutes and check against database, like you said.

Just check those once a minute and unless all the subreddits put together get more than 100 comments a minute you won't miss anything.\nRechecking will depend on how often you want to recheck.

I'm not sure what your exact use case is, but I've found the Mod Queue to be particularly helpful for just checking for filtered or reports. If you're trying to build a backlog or history of all submitted posts to review, then I would definitely go the local database route and build your own UI that can display an X amount of posts every N minutes. This could be just a single API call using PRAW.\nFor comments: Comments needs posts to exist so I think you could build your own algorithm or system that would best suit your monitoring needs. For example, you could check for the three top voted posts in the past N minutes and then store the comments there.

As a PM, I wouldn't be coding, so I shouldn't really program a product like developers would, since PM skills rely mostly on user-facing aspects. Would I just do everything up to the building part (research, creating decks, figma, etc.) and that would be considered a completed side project? Or would I need to release and get metrics from it?

Currently working in Accounting  - trying to switch over to an PM. Prior to accounting I worked in TV development for 2 years and lead a team of 30+ people across 3 departments. No coding experience or knowledge but am considering going back to school for my MBA if it will help. Looking to move away from TV development and begin making the jump into an APM/PM role once my contract with current company ends. Advice on the next best move?\nHoping this is the right place to post, tried on some other subs but haven't had much engagement - I'm looking for any information on how to transition from a TV Dev/Accountant to a Product Manager.\nBACKGROUND / CONTEXT - I’m 23 years old. Graduated with a B.Sc. in Accounting in December 2022. During college I landed a job on a number of very popular traveling TV shows and eventually moved into TV development (bringing show ideas to life) where I led a team of 30+ people across 3 departments. Essentially, I was a PM but for a television show. For the past two years, my life has consisted of going to school for half of the year, and developing/working on television during the other half.\nWhen the strike hit, I decided to pick up a temporary job as a contracted accountant helping a company tie out their books for the end of the year. My original plan was to return to developing television shows once the contract ends, but I was recently encouraged to look into the Product Management career path by one of my mentors who has experience in the tech field.\nUpon looking into the role, making the switch while I’m still young seems like a no brainer. TV development isn’t nearly as secure or lucrative of a career, and quite frankly I’ve felt that my business acumen has been going to waste in the field. Accounting is also not something I see myself in long term as it’s not creative, very objective, and involves lot of solo projects without team collaboration. I’m already very well-read/interested/curious about the tech field as a whole, I thrive in collaborative team-driven environments, I could essentially continue doing what I love (bringing a product from A-B), and increase my salary by almost 3x — all signs point to this being a good transition to make while I’m wrapping up my current contract.\nWhich brings me to now. I don’t know the first thing about coding, so I’m looking for advice on how to proceed. What principles do I need to study to make this work? Would it help to go back to school? Do I need to complete a bootcamp or get certifications? How will I know if I’m ready to start applying for positions? And when I am, which kind of positions should I be applying for, and at what size company? I know it’s a handful of questions, but any general guidance would be greatly appreciated. I’m aware it won’t be easy, but I’m willing and able to take the time required to make this transition work.\nSide note — while going through this shift I’ve also been considering going back to school to get my MBA, but I’ve heard some conflicting opinions on whether it’s a good idea for getting into Product Management. Some say it doesn’t matter and it’s better to get straight into the field however you can, but I’ve also read well-supported posts like this (on this sub) that indicate that an MBA program could directly help you get into an APM program.

The plan was for me to pick up a direct report this Fall, but layoffs nixed that and any foreseeable people management opportunities. I was fortunately not affected by the layoffs.\nThrough some frank conversations with my manager (Senior Director of Product), title changes and a compensation increase are both very possible right now.\nFocusing on titles. Given that we're a startup there is quite a bit of flexibility. I could push for Principal/Staff PM, Director of Product, Group PM, or Lead PM. I would remain an IC in all scenarios. I do have eventual goals of managing other PMs.\nMy current take is that taking on any of the people management titles (Director, Group, Lead) might discredit the promotion in future interviews.

At best, you have many different skills at beginner level, but few skills at advanced level.\nIt’s much harder for PMs at startups to advance in their careers. The engineering team has to double or triple in size to need enough PMs who need to be managed. Also, strong startups often hire Senior PMs (there are good reasons for that), so even more challenging to grow into a coach or manager role whilst having tons of IC responsibilities still.\nBeing the first PM is hard for many reasons, but it also often sucks because you need to carve your own space relative to the founder. This is fraught with risks and obstacles. A lot depends heavily on who the founder is, their personality and maturity level, their attachment to product, the domain, etc.\nBeing strong at “zero-to-one” is mostly fiction. Every startup is different and what works in one may completely fail at another.

Hopefully you can find the value in here even if it’s just one sentence. Sorry it’s not formatted more clearly or more succinct! —-\nHaving done this, my first suggestion is to figure out where are the biggest fires, where are they feeling pressure (internally and externally) to get something done, why did they hire a PM and think they need one?\nBe prepared to wear lots of hats and commit to outcomes not a job description. You’ll enjoy your job more and if you’re with a good team they’ll be great to work with. It’s just the nature of a startup and if you have good talent and good culture you’ll operate much faster when you’re positioning people to do what they’re best at - sometimes this means youre not the visionary - in fact it’s a red flag if the CEO/CTO stop wanting to influence product heavily. The product is the business and when an early stage founder steps back too early the business can suffer.\nThey do have to make sure they aren’t micromanaging, but it’s empowering to have their buy-in and frankly if one of the cofounders isn’t strategic and strong in vision, the startup will fail anyhow. They can’t both just be operators/executor’s. And they can’t put the weight of vision on a non-founder.\nBesides getting to know the strategic priorities and problems they’re hoping you solve, use the weapon of your time to become an expert on the customer. Up till now people have been all over the place and no one has had the time to talk with customers. They’ve been busy pitching investors, selling customers, building the foundation, etc. - frankly they probably know where there are problems, but don’t actually know problems in-depth yet.\nAlong with building expertise in customers, build your next level of influence by building relationships with people in the org. Many startups face disconnects between sales/marketing and product. Be that bridge.\nFinally, if you’re looking for a problem to solve and guide your efforts, the easiest way is to take a look at the funnel and customer journey.\nWhat’s the state of the product? All the way from awareness, capture and closing to retention and promotion. Now figure out why. \nThe sooner you can do this the sooner you can build impact on the org. It’s the easiest way to start and guide your efforts. My other tip is search for the “Aha moment”. What’s the moment that it all clicks for the customer when they’re on the journey. Where they see the value and the implications of the product. How can you help move that to the front. If it doesn’t exist yet, you don’t have enough user value today and you need to build and build. (If you don’t have it yet, usually a bit early to get a PM imo because priority in resources should be building off gut and small feedback loops until you get that value, but you can still succeed if they haven’t found it).\n","author":"LearnQuick","score":11,"created":1700418139,"link_id":"t3_17z1nn3","permalink":"www.reddit.com/r/ProductManagement/comments/17z1nn3/first_pm/k9x0cn1/"},{"id":"k9wtkzw","name":"t1_k9wtkzw","body_html":"I just quit after being the first product person, so same situation.

SMs/PMs will get fired first for missing specific project targets, while overall bad product vision takes longer to be discovered (and is much easier to pass the blame) so bad product managers will not get fired until much later.\n","author":"angelsgirl85","score":1,"created":1700348694,"link_id":"t3_17ybbk3","permalink":"www.reddit.com/r/ProductManagement/comments/17ybbk3/do_you_agree_with_this_result/k9tkviu/"},{"id":"k9tmjn7","name":"t1_k9tmjn7","body_html":"This made me chuckle!\nDepending on the stage of the company the same person can be all of these.\nExhibit - myself, PM at pre series A startup.\nSo you know my answer - Product Management in my context includes doing everything.

Hopefully you can find the value in here even if it’s just one sentence. Sorry it’s not formatted more clearly or more succinct! —-\nHaving done this, my first suggestion is to figure out where are the biggest fires, where are they feeling pressure (internally and externally) to get something done, why did they hire a PM and think they need one?\nBe prepared to wear lots of hats and commit to outcomes not a job description. You’ll enjoy your job more and if you’re with a good team they’ll be great to work with. It’s just the nature of a startup and if you have good talent and good culture you’ll operate much faster when you’re positioning people to do what they’re best at - sometimes this means youre not the visionary - in fact it’s a red flag if the CEO/CTO stop wanting to influence product heavily. The product is the business and when an early stage founder steps back too early the business can suffer.\nThey do have to make sure they aren’t micromanaging, but it’s empowering to have their buy-in and frankly if one of the cofounders isn’t strategic and strong in vision, the startup will fail anyhow. They can’t both just be operators/executor’s. And they can’t put the weight of vision on a non-founder.\nBesides getting to know the strategic priorities and problems they’re hoping you solve, use the weapon of your time to become an expert on the customer. Up till now people have been all over the place and no one has had the time to talk with customers. They’ve been busy pitching investors, selling customers, building the foundation, etc. - frankly they probably know where there are problems, but don’t actually know problems in-depth yet.\nAlong with building expertise in customers, build your next level of influence by building relationships with people in the org. Many startups face disconnects between sales/marketing and product. Be that bridge.\nFinally, if you’re looking for a problem to solve and guide your efforts, the easiest way is to take a look at the funnel and customer journey.\nWhat’s the state of the product? All the way from awareness, capture and closing to retention and promotion. Now figure out why. \nThe sooner you can do this the sooner you can build impact on the org. It’s the easiest way to start and guide your efforts. My other tip is search for the “Aha moment”. What’s the moment that it all clicks for the customer when they’re on the journey. Where they see the value and the implications of the product. How can you help move that to the front. If it doesn’t exist yet, you don’t have enough user value today and you need to build and build. (If you don’t have it yet, usually a bit early to get a PM imo because priority in resources should be building off gut and small feedback loops until you get that value, but you can still succeed if they haven’t found it).\n","author":"LearnQuick","score":12,"created":1700418139,"link_id":"t3_17z1nn3","permalink":"www.reddit.com/r/ProductManagement/comments/17z1nn3/first_pm/k9x0cn1/"},{"id":"k9wtkzw","name":"t1_k9wtkzw","body_html":"I just quit after being the first product person, so same situation.

How do you get a job as a PM when nearly every job listing asks for 5 years of PM experience?\n2. What books are best for starting out in the PM world? I don't see a strong consensus on this subreddit when I look up book reccomendation threads here. I'm also skeptical of the frequently reccomended Gayle Laakmann McDowell book, because I think her analogous software engineering book is brutally overrated.\n3. Is there any real meaningful difference between Product vs Project vs Program Management?\n4. Do I need to do LeetCode if I'm pursuing PM roles at tech companies? This is one of the things I dislike the most about the Software Engineering industry. Having to grind and study everytime I want to job hop is soul crushing.\n5. Is there a huge different between roles labelled something like \"Engineering Manager\" and \"Product Manager\". Is the former totally uninvolved with UX and Business?\n6. Is understanding Technical System Design important?

Currently working in Accounting  - trying to switch over to an PM. Prior to accounting I worked in TV development for 2 years and lead a team of 30+ people across 3 departments. No coding experience or knowledge but am considering going back to school for my MBA if it will help. Looking to move away from TV development and begin making the jump into an APM/PM role once my contract with current company ends. Advice on the next best move?\nHoping this is the right place to post, tried on some other subs but haven't had much engagement - I'm looking for any information on how to transition from a TV Dev/Accountant to a Product Manager.\nBACKGROUND / CONTEXT - I’m 23 years old. Graduated with a B.Sc. in Accounting in December 2022. During college I landed a job on a number of very popular traveling TV shows and eventually moved into TV development (bringing show ideas to life) where I led a team of 30+ people across 3 departments. Essentially, I was a PM but for a television show. For the past two years, my life has consisted of going to school for half of the year, and developing/working on television during the other half.\nWhen the strike hit, I decided to pick up a temporary job as a contracted accountant helping a company tie out their books for the end of the year. My original plan was to return to developing television shows once the contract ends, but I was recently encouraged to look into the Product Management career path by one of my mentors who has experience in the tech field.\nUpon looking into the role, making the switch while I’m still young seems like a no brainer. TV development isn’t nearly as secure or lucrative of a career, and quite frankly I’ve felt that my business acumen has been going to waste in the field. Accounting is also not something I see myself in long term as it’s not creative, very objective, and involves lot of solo projects without team collaboration. I’m already very well-read/interested/curious about the tech field as a whole, I thrive in collaborative team-driven environments, I could essentially continue doing what I love (bringing a product from A-B), and increase my salary by almost 3x — all signs point to this being a good transition to make while I’m wrapping up my current contract.\nWhich brings me to now. I don’t know the first thing about coding, so I’m looking for advice on how to proceed. What principles do I need to study to make this work? Would it help to go back to school? Do I need to complete a bootcamp or get certifications? How will I know if I’m ready to start applying for positions? And when I am, which kind of positions should I be applying for, and at what size company? I know it’s a handful of questions, but any general guidance would be greatly appreciated. I’m aware it won’t be easy, but I’m willing and able to take the time required to make this transition work.\nSide note — while going through this shift I’ve also been considering going back to school to get my MBA, but I’ve heard some conflicting opinions on whether it’s a good idea for getting into Product Management. Some say it doesn’t matter and it’s better to get straight into the field however you can, but I’ve also read well-supported posts like this (on this sub) that indicate that an MBA program could directly help you get into an APM program. Is someone able to explain this a little more in depth?\nThanks so much in advance!\n","author":"ColonelMelon","score":1,"created":1698951165,"link_id":"t3_16jlqhw","permalink":"www.reddit.com/r/ProductManagement/comments/16jlqhw/quarterly_career_thread/k7jm3f1/"},{"id":"k7j49al","name":"t1_k7j49al","body_html":"I’m currently interviewing for a IT project manager role at a fortune 500 company. would this look good on my resume if my goal is to become a product manager in the near future? or is it too far off to have any relevance?\n","author":"RubFun5630","score":1,"created":1698944738,"link_id":"t3_16jlqhw","permalink":"www.reddit.com/r/ProductManagement/comments/16jlqhw/quarterly_career_thread/k7j49al/"},{"id":"k7hr8ca","name":"t1_k7hr8ca","body_html":"Recommendations on certifications or courses or degrees to help me in my new PM role. \nI was just asked this summer to be the PM for a new chemical line within my current company.

At best, you have many different skills at beginner level, but few skills at advanced level.\nIt’s much harder for PMs at startups to advance in their careers. The engineering team has to double or triple in size to need enough PMs who need to be managed. Also, strong startups often hire Senior PMs (there are good reasons for that), so even more challenging to grow into a coach or manager role whilst having tons of IC responsibilities still.\nBeing the first PM is hard for many reasons, but it also often sucks because you need to carve your own space relative to the founder. This is fraught with risks and obstacles. A lot depends heavily on who the founder is, their personality and maturity level, their attachment to product, the domain, etc.\nBeing strong at “zero-to-one” is mostly fiction. Every startup is different and what works in one may completely fail at another. And if you’re actually super strong, then why not become a founder?\nJob search is the worst. \nPre-seed and seed stage startups are often ill suited for a PM - it’s way too early. \nSeries B+ and large companies: you start running into recruiter filtering problem since (a) your experience is likely at unknown startups, (b) answering “tell me about a time” questions is challenging, since you’re trying to paint “drinking from a fire hose”, “fighting fires”, and often a general shitshow as a rational framework-based proper product management experience.\nSeries A is possibly a sweet spot, but again too few PM roles (or too many, which is a red flag too) and the aforementioned first PM problem.\n","author":"dogswanttobiteme","score":3,"created":1700165897,"link_id":"t3_17wja60","permalink":"www.reddit.com/r/ProductManagement/comments/17wja60/weekly_rant_thread/k9jpyj7/"},{"id":"k9hn9m7","name":"t1_k9hn9m7","body_html":"[deleted]\n","author":"[deleted]","score":1,"created":1700135647,"link_id":"t3_17wja60","permalink":"www.reddit.com/r/ProductManagement/comments/17wja60/weekly_rant_thread/k9hn9m7/"},{"id":"k9nzoke","name":"t1_k9nzoke","body_html":"Why do you have to create a new account on a workday for every app?????\n","author":"Owlpm","score":1,"created":1700245327,"link_id":"t3_17wja60","permalink":"www.reddit.com/r/ProductManagement/comments/17wja60/weekly_rant_thread/k9nzoke/"},{"id":"k9pb1h5","name":"t1_k9pb1h5","body_html":"I'm so tired.

You’ll enjoy your job more and if you’re with a good team they’ll be great to work with. It’s just the nature of a startup and if you have good talent and good culture you’ll operate much faster when you’re positioning people to do what they’re best at - sometimes this means youre not the visionary - in fact it’s a red flag if the CEO/CTO stop wanting to influence product heavily. The product is the business and when an early stage founder steps back too early the business can suffer.\nThey do have to make sure they aren’t micromanaging, but it’s empowering to have their buy-in and frankly if one of the cofounders isn’t strategic and strong in vision, the startup will fail anyhow. They can’t both just be operators/executor’s. And they can’t put the weight of vision on a non-founder.\nBesides getting to know the strategic priorities and problems they’re hoping you solve, use the weapon of your time to become an expert on the customer. Up till now people have been all over the place and no one has had the time to talk with customers. They’ve been busy pitching investors, selling customers, building the foundation, etc. - frankly they probably know where there are problems, but don’t actually know problems in-depth yet.\nAlong with building expertise in customers, build your next level of influence by building relationships with people in the org. Many startups face disconnects between sales/marketing and product. Be that bridge.\nFinally, if you’re looking for a problem to solve and guide your efforts, the easiest way is to take a look at the funnel and customer journey.\nWhat’s the state of the product? All the way from awareness, capture and closing to retention and promotion. Now figure out why. \nThe sooner you can do this the sooner you can build impact on the org. It’s the easiest way to start and guide your efforts. My other tip is search for the “Aha moment”. What’s the moment that it all clicks for the customer when they’re on the journey. Where they see the value and the implications of the product. How can you help move that to the front. If it doesn’t exist yet, you don’t have enough user value today and you need to build and build. (If you don’t have it yet, usually a bit early to get a PM imo because priority in resources should be building off gut and small feedback loops until you get that value, but you can still succeed if they haven’t found it).\n","author":"LearnQuick","score":11,"created":1700418139,"link_id":"t3_17z1nn3","permalink":"www.reddit.com/r/ProductManagement/comments/17z1nn3/first_pm/k9x0cn1/"},{"id":"k9wtkzw","name":"t1_k9wtkzw","body_html":"I just quit after being the first product person, so same situation.
