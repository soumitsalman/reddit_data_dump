Lately, I wake up every day with this feeling of dread, which is the total opposite of how I felt as little as a year ago.\n\nI do think my current situation sucks (unsupportive manager, several quarters of company missing revenue targets, needlessly hectic environment, very political organization), but I don‚Äôt think just moving to a new company will fix things. I also don‚Äôt think taking a sabbatical/long vacation will work, since I would go back to the same working situation that I am currently in.\n\nHave any of you ever been in this situation before? What did you do?\n\nE: Have any of you NOT burnt out? How have you handled your career as a PM to avoid burning out?",

      "post_content": "I'm having one of those days, if you're a PM than you know... I've been thinking about other jobs,other careers, and what I really wish I could say.  If you have your own list, I'd love to hear it.  If you think I suck, well, we probably won't cross paths anyway.\n\nDear potential employer,\n\nI'm writing to you today to tell you all of the reasons that you shouldn't hire me as a PM in your organization.  I'll try and keep it short, but it's a long list that you should carefully consider before we book our next meeting.\n\n1. I love customers.  I want to talk to them every chance I get, even the angry ones.\n2. I don't always get #1 right, but I'm always honest and transparent about what we're doing.\n3. I often get #1 right, and if you based my job performance on solving for the customer, I'd be retired by now.\n4. I don't think your middle managers are useful, at all.  Fire them yesterday.  I ask them for context about the business and they can't answer.  They don't know whats going on, why decisions are made, or they won't share it,, or you aren't transparent with them about what's going on and why.  If you're going to keep them see #5, but no one really seems happy with this whole arrangement.\n5. I don't want to be in repetitive weekly meetings, especially performance 1-1s.  See 4, if I have to create a 1-1 template that outlines my own \"growth and support opportunities\" because you don't know what's going on in my projects, you're wasting my time each week, and probably not effectively communicating with your own leaders about what's happening.\n6. I'm old, and I'm grumpy.  I've explained this to 900000 people before you, appoint someone else to carry the flag of justice, or, you know, just ask questions of the other 20 people you manage, find the truth in yourself and fix it.\n7. Stop making me the \"mentor\" of the group so that you can ignore the feedback in #6.\n8. I put up numbers that exceed targets, go away.\n\nSort of a tongue and cheek, but really relevant to my Q4 grump.  What are your \"don't hire me if you expect Xes?\"",

The c level has their heads on straight as well as the boots on the ground folks. It‚Äôs the fucking PowerPoint GAANT gurus I find myself entertaining to be polite. Mucking up progress in the name of flagrant self promotion and obsession with irrelevant documentation that does nothing to move the needle. And if the good solution wasn‚Äôt their idea they flail as if being undermined instead of trying to understand why this is the best path forward. Some feel threatened by the talent of the employees they actively manage.\n\nIs it this way at other companies? Pls share your commiserations below üïØÔ∏è",

There are valuable things in the commends of a lot of these negative posts but I think this community could benefit from talking about the positives of product management!   \n\n\nI'll start. I love that I get to work with basically the entire organization. I talk to marketing about how things should be positioned, work with post-sales as a centralized discovery channel to see where the major pain points are. Work with sales to see how we \"stack up\" against what the competition is saying. And obviously working with developers - which i find fascinating as you get to try to wrap your head around pretty complex stuff and work with some extremely bright folks in the process! I also love being creative. Whether it be talking about the general approach, how to find an approach that solves short term problems but can be iterated on to become something more complete and powerful, working with designers, etc... \n\nI LOVE my job. There are things I hate. I get pulled into 5-7 hours of meetings every day and I work 50-60 hour weeks. But I'd rather work hard on something I love than work 40 hours a week and count down to 5pm every day. I'd love to hear from yall about why you love product management! ",

      "post_content": "Recently I was approached by the recruiter from a public tech company. The company has proprietary data analytics B2B SaaS enterprise software. They market this software as the end-to-end data ecosystem that entails data ingestion, data analytics, to management fully operating using this tool. This role belongs to its Business Development team, where I need to talk to customer, figure out their needs, then customize and deploy this software for the customer. I would be paired with an engineer who does most of the technical heavy lifting, but I also need to be hands on  coding when needed. It‚Äôs framed  as a low-code tool, but from what I gathered there definitely needs to be significant amount of data pipeline building (Python) and web widget configuration (JS/TS) needed to be able to fully deploy for users. I am fluent in Python and R from previous DS job, but I definitely don‚Äôt want to be heads down coding all the time.\n\nNow the question is: My background is in consulting &amp; data science.  I am looking to pivot to product manager role. Recruiter told me this role is a perfect opportunity that combines my prior experience with product management. I am somewhat doubtful - because this company has a separate Product Development team (where there are actual roles called Product Manager). What this role entails is more like IT consulting and project management. I don‚Äôt see how I could truly do ‚Äúproduct management‚Äù and ‚Äúproduct strategy‚Äù as I am the intermediary user of their platform and have no say in what the core platform would look like, except how it would look like when configured right for the end users. But maybe I‚Äôm reading it wrong. Would love to hear some opinions from experienced PM who have seen the operations of similar companies. \n\nThank you!",

      "post_content": "Hi all. I‚Äôm a mid level PM and was recently added to our ‚Äúbugs‚Äù team to help provide some guidance and strategic thinking to what gets resolved and when. Here‚Äôs the situation: we are extremely thin on resources and this team handles bugs for all areas of our product. Over the past few years the bugs prioritization process has included 0 product input but the team‚Äôs work is instead based on what our head of customer experience and our head of support think should be resolved and when. This is obviously a problem for many reasons, but one of the key issues is that they do not believe in anything less than medium - everything becomes high priority and high urgency. This then skews their metrics to show there are excessive numbers of high priority issues and they are not being resolved quickly enough. Knowing I‚Äôm about to burst their bubble, I was thinking of coming up with a framework for reported bugs (MoSCoW, WSJF, etc) so that it is less ‚Äúopinion‚Äù based and there is more structure to bugs meetings vs everything being called out in a panic. Have any of you gone through something like this before or have any tips on slowly pulling the reins back to product and not based on Support? Any advice is welcome!",

I recently got some advice that my resume may \"be all over the place.\"\n\nI'm at a crossroads and would appreciate your thoughts:\n\n1. **Specialization vs. Diversification**: Should I focus on building further expertise in a specific area like transportation/mobility? Or is it more advantageous to continue gaining diverse experiences across various sectors at name brands?\n2. **FAANG and Consulting Perspectives**: When hiring, do companies in FAANG or the consulting sector prefer candidates with a niche focus or those with a broader range of experiences? (I'm also recruiting consulting)\n\nThank you!!",

If you have your own list, I'd love to hear it.  If you think I suck, well, we probably won't cross paths anyway.\n\nDear potential employer,\n\nI'm writing to you today to tell you all of the reasons that you shouldn't hire me as a PM in your organization.  I'll try and keep it short, but it's a long list that you should carefully consider before we book our next meeting.\n\n1. I love customers.  I want to talk to them every chance I get, even the angry ones.\n2. I don't always get #1 right, but I'm always honest and transparent about what we're doing.\n3. I often get #1 right, and if you based my job performance on solving for the customer, I'd be retired by now.\n4. I don't think your middle managers are useful, at all.  Fire them yesterday.  I ask them for context about the business and they can't answer.  They don't know whats going on, why decisions are made, or they won't share it,, or you aren't transparent with them about what's going on and why.  If you're going to keep them see #5, but no one really seems happy with this whole arrangement.\n5. I don't want to be in repetitive weekly meetings, especially performance 1-1s.  See 4, if I have to create a 1-1 template that outlines my own \"growth and support opportunities\" because you don't know what's going on in my projects, you're wasting my time each week, and probably not effectively communicating with your own leaders about what's happening.\n6. I'm old, and I'm grumpy.  I've explained this to 900000 people before you, appoint someone else to carry the flag of justice, or, you know, just ask questions of the other 20 people you manage, find the truth in yourself and fix it.\n7. Stop making me the \"mentor\" of the group so that you can ignore the feedback in #6.\n8. I put up numbers that exceed targets, go away.\n\nSort of a tongue and cheek, but really relevant to my Q4 grump.  What are your \"don't hire me if you expect Xes?\"",

Here‚Äôs the situation: we are extremely thin on resources and this team handles bugs for all areas of our product. Over the past few years the bugs prioritization process has included 0 product input but the team‚Äôs work is instead based on what our head of customer experience and our head of support think should be resolved and when. This is obviously a problem for many reasons, but one of the key issues is that they do not believe in anything less than medium - everything becomes high priority and high urgency. This then skews their metrics to show there are excessive numbers of high priority issues and they are not being resolved quickly enough. Knowing I‚Äôm about to burst their bubble, I was thinking of coming up with a framework for reported bugs (MoSCoW, WSJF, etc) so that it is less ‚Äúopinion‚Äù based and there is more structure to bugs meetings vs everything being called out in a panic. Have any of you gone through something like this before or have any tips on slowly pulling the reins back to product and not based on Support? Any advice is welcome!",

I love that I get to work with basically the entire organization. I talk to marketing about how things should be positioned, work with post-sales as a centralized discovery channel to see where the major pain points are. Work with sales to see how we \"stack up\" against what the competition is saying. And obviously working with developers - which i find fascinating as you get to try to wrap your head around pretty complex stuff and work with some extremely bright folks in the process! I also love being creative. Whether it be talking about the general approach, how to find an approach that solves short term problems but can be iterated on to become something more complete and powerful, working with designers, etc... \n\nI LOVE my job. There are things I hate. I get pulled into 5-7 hours of meetings every day and I work 50-60 hour weeks.

If you have your own list, I'd love to hear it.  If you think I suck, well, we probably won't cross paths anyway.\n\nDear potential employer,\n\nI'm writing to you today to tell you all of the reasons that you shouldn't hire me as a PM in your organization.  I'll try and keep it short, but it's a long list that you should carefully consider before we book our next meeting.\n\n1. I love customers.  I want to talk to them every chance I get, even the angry ones.\n2. I don't always get #1 right, but I'm always honest and transparent about what we're doing.\n3. I often get #1 right, and if you based my job performance on solving for the customer, I'd be retired by now.\n4. I don't think your middle managers are useful, at all.  Fire them yesterday.  I ask them for context about the business and they can't answer.  They don't know whats going on, why decisions are made, or they won't share it,, or you aren't transparent with them about what's going on and why.  If you're going to keep them see #5, but no one really seems happy with this whole arrangement.\n5. I don't want to be in repetitive weekly meetings, especially performance 1-1s.  See 4, if I have to create a 1-1 template that outlines my own \"growth and support opportunities\" because you don't know what's going on in my projects, you're wasting my time each week, and probably not effectively communicating with your own leaders about what's happening.\n6. I'm old, and I'm grumpy.  I've explained this to 900000 people before you, appoint someone else to carry the flag of justice, or, you know, just ask questions of the other 20 people you manage, find the truth in yourself and fix it.\n7. Stop making me the \"mentor\" of the group so that you can ignore the feedback in #6.\n8. I put up numbers that exceed targets, go away.\n\nSort of a tongue and cheek, but really relevant to my Q4 grump.  What are your \"don't hire me if you expect Xes?\"",

I talk to marketing about how things should be positioned, work with post-sales as a centralized discovery channel to see where the major pain points are. Work with sales to see how we \"stack up\" against what the competition is saying. And obviously working with developers - which i find fascinating as you get to try to wrap your head around pretty complex stuff and work with some extremely bright folks in the process! I also love being creative. Whether it be talking about the general approach, how to find an approach that solves short term problems but can be iterated on to become something more complete and powerful, working with designers, etc... \n\nI LOVE my job. There are things I hate. I get pulled into 5-7 hours of meetings every day and I work 50-60 hour weeks.

      "post_content": "Recently I was approached by the recruiter from a public tech company. The company has proprietary data analytics B2B SaaS enterprise software. They market this software as the end-to-end data ecosystem that entails data ingestion, data analytics, to management fully operating using this tool. This role belongs to its Business Development team, where I need to talk to customer, figure out their needs, then customize and deploy this software for the customer. I would be paired with an engineer who does most of the technical heavy lifting, but I also need to be hands on  coding when needed. It‚Äôs framed  as a low-code tool, but from what I gathered there definitely needs to be significant amount of data pipeline building (Python) and web widget configuration (JS/TS) needed to be able to fully deploy for users. I am fluent in Python and R from previous DS job, but I definitely don‚Äôt want to be heads down coding all the time.\n\nNow the question is: My background is in consulting &amp; data science.  I am looking to pivot to product manager role. Recruiter told me this role is a perfect opportunity that combines my prior experience with product management. I am somewhat doubtful - because this company has a separate Product Development team (where there are actual roles called Product Manager). What this role entails is more like IT consulting and project management. I don‚Äôt see how I could truly do ‚Äúproduct management‚Äù and ‚Äúproduct strategy‚Äù as I am the intermediary user of their platform and have no say in what the core platform would look like, except how it would look like when configured right for the end users. But maybe I‚Äôm reading it wrong. Would love to hear some opinions from experienced PM who have seen the operations of similar companies. \n\nThank you!",

Here‚Äôs the situation: we are extremely thin on resources and this team handles bugs for all areas of our product. Over the past few years the bugs prioritization process has included 0 product input but the team‚Äôs work is instead based on what our head of customer experience and our head of support think should be resolved and when. This is obviously a problem for many reasons, but one of the key issues is that they do not believe in anything less than medium - everything becomes high priority and high urgency. This then skews their metrics to show there are excessive numbers of high priority issues and they are not being resolved quickly enough. Knowing I‚Äôm about to burst their bubble, I was thinking of coming up with a framework for reported bugs (MoSCoW, WSJF, etc) so that it is less ‚Äúopinion‚Äù based and there is more structure to bugs meetings vs everything being called out in a panic. Have any of you gone through something like this before or have any tips on slowly pulling the reins back to product and not based on Support? Any advice is welcome!",

      "post_content": "Greetings, all!\n\nI'm currently building a full-stack application using Next.js as the frontend and Django as the backend. The backend currently handles user registration/authorisation by storing JWTs in HttpOnly cookies. However, I plan on incorporating heavy use of the Reddit API through PRAW and I was wondering what the best practice would be for handling the OAuth route.\n\nWhat I have in mind at the moment for the code flow is this:\n\n1. After the user activates their account (be it through email activation or social login), the user is redirected to the authorisation URL that PRAW generates. I'll need to send this authorisation URL back to the frontend to render, which I'm not sure is a good idea or not.\n2. The user authorises Reddit access to a third party-app, which is the web app I am building.\n3. The user is redirected to the frontend home page on Next.js.\n\nI'm not an experienced dev by any means so I was also wondering where I should be putting the PRAW code to minimise the amount of calls that frontend needs to make to backend, or if I should have frontend do the bulk of the work instead‚Äîso scrapping PRAW as it uses Python and make direct calls to Reddit's API with Express/Axios instead. If I keep the PRAW logic in the back, then it means the frontend will need to make constant calls to the backend, which is then making calls through PRAW and then sending the data back to the frontend.\n\nHowever, I do want to store the state for each user in the backend for safety reasons. I'm also thinking of storing a permanent refresh token in the backend as well for multi-use, but I'm also uncertain if that's good practice.\n\nI'd greatly appreciate any advice or suggestions! Thank you!",

I'm not very experienced with python as I'm coming from R.\n\nSo what I am trying to do is: Use the Reddit API to get all comments from a list of 2000+ Threads. I already have the list of Threads and I also managed to write a for loop over these Threads, but I am getting 429 HTTP Error; as I've realized I was going over the ratelimit. \n\nAs I totally dont mind at all if this routine needs a long time to run I would like to make the loop wait until the API lets me get comments again. \n\nIs there any simple solution to this?\n\nThe only idea I have is write a function to get all the comments from all threads that are not in another dataframe already and if it fails it waits 10 minutes and calls the same function again.\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

Turns out, there is now a LIFETIME limit of just **3** apps per developer!  Try to create more and it'll throw an error with a link to create a support ticket.\n\nI've already submitted that ticket and will resume my work if/when the new restriction is removed from my account.  But as of now I am blocked so support for Reddit.NET is officially on hiatus until this is resolved.  I do realize I've already delayed the next release a bunch of times and I apologize for any inconvenience.",

      "post_content": "Greetings, all!\n\nI'm currently building a full-stack application using Next.js as the frontend and Django as the backend. The backend currently handles user registration/authorisation by storing JWTs in HttpOnly cookies. However, I plan on incorporating heavy use of the Reddit API through PRAW and I was wondering what the best practice would be for handling the OAuth route.\n\nWhat I have in mind at the moment for the code flow is this:\n\n1. After the user activates their account (be it through email activation or social login), the user is redirected to the authorisation URL that PRAW generates. I'll need to send this authorisation URL back to the frontend to render, which I'm not sure is a good idea or not.\n2. The user authorises Reddit access to a third party-app, which is the web app I am building.\n3. The user is redirected to the frontend home page on Next.js.\n\nI'm not an experienced dev by any means so I was also wondering where I should be putting the PRAW code to minimise the amount of calls that frontend needs to make to backend, or if I should have frontend do the bulk of the work instead‚Äîso scrapping PRAW as it uses Python and make direct calls to Reddit's API with Express/Axios instead. If I keep the PRAW logic in the back, then it means the frontend will need to make constant calls to the backend, which is then making calls through PRAW and then sending the data back to the frontend.\n\nHowever, I do want to store the state for each user in the backend for safety reasons. I'm also thinking of storing a permanent refresh token in the backend as well for multi-use, but I'm also uncertain if that's good practice.\n\nI'd greatly appreciate any advice or suggestions! Thank you!",

I'm not very experienced with python as I'm coming from R.\n\nSo what I am trying to do is: Use the Reddit API to get all comments from a list of 2000+ Threads. I already have the list of Threads and I also managed to write a for loop over these Threads, but I am getting 429 HTTP Error; as I've realized I was going over the ratelimit. \n\nAs I totally dont mind at all if this routine needs a long time to run I would like to make the loop wait until the API lets me get comments again. \n\nIs there any simple solution to this?\n\nThe only idea I have is write a function to get all the comments from all threads that are not in another dataframe already and if it fails it waits 10 minutes and calls the same function again.\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

Turns out, there is now a LIFETIME limit of just **3** apps per developer!  Try to create more and it'll throw an error with a link to create a support ticket.\n\nI've already submitted that ticket and will resume my work if/when the new restriction is removed from my account.  But as of now I am blocked so support for Reddit.NET is officially on hiatus until this is resolved.

If you have your own list, I'd love to hear it.  If you think I suck, well, we probably won't cross paths anyway.\n\nDear potential employer,\n\nI'm writing to you today to tell you all of the reasons that you shouldn't hire me as a PM in your organization.  I'll try and keep it short, but it's a long list that you should carefully consider before we book our next meeting.\n\n1. I love customers.  I want to talk to them every chance I get, even the angry ones.\n2. I don't always get #1 right, but I'm always honest and transparent about what we're doing.\n3. I often get #1 right, and if you based my job performance on solving for the customer, I'd be retired by now.\n4. I don't think your middle managers are useful, at all.  Fire them yesterday.  I ask them for context about the business and they can't answer.  They don't know whats going on, why decisions are made, or they won't share it,, or you aren't transparent with them about what's going on and why.  If you're going to keep them see #5, but no one really seems happy with this whole arrangement.\n5. I don't want to be in repetitive weekly meetings, especially performance 1-1s.  See 4, if I have to create a 1-1 template that outlines my own \"growth and support opportunities\" because you don't know what's going on in my projects, you're wasting my time each week, and probably not effectively communicating with your own leaders about what's happening.\n6. I'm old, and I'm grumpy.  I've explained this to 900000 people before you, appoint someone else to carry the flag of justice, or, you know, just ask questions of the other 20 people you manage, find the truth in yourself and fix it.\n7. Stop making me the \"mentor\" of the group so that you can ignore the feedback in #6.\n8. I put up numbers that exceed targets, go away.\n\nSort of a tongue and cheek, but really relevant to my Q4 grump.  What are your \"don't hire me if you expect Xes?\"",

I talk to marketing about how things should be positioned, work with post-sales as a centralized discovery channel to see where the major pain points are.

And obviously working with developers - which i find fascinating as you get to try to wrap your head around pretty complex stuff and work with some extremely bright folks in the process! I also love being creative. Whether it be talking about the general approach, how to find an approach that solves short term problems but can be iterated on to become something more complete and powerful, working with designers, etc... \n\nI LOVE my job.

      "post_content": "Recently I was approached by the recruiter from a public tech company. The company has proprietary data analytics B2B SaaS enterprise software. They market this software as the end-to-end data ecosystem that entails data ingestion, data analytics, to management fully operating using this tool. This role belongs to its Business Development team, where I need to talk to customer, figure out their needs, then customize and deploy this software for the customer. I would be paired with an engineer who does most of the technical heavy lifting, but I also need to be hands on  coding when needed. It‚Äôs framed  as a low-code tool, but from what I gathered there definitely needs to be significant amount of data pipeline building (Python) and web widget configuration (JS/TS) needed to be able to fully deploy for users. I am fluent in Python and R from previous DS job, but I definitely don‚Äôt want to be heads down coding all the time.\n\nNow the question is: My background is in consulting &amp; data science.  I am looking to pivot to product manager role. Recruiter told me this role is a perfect opportunity that combines my prior experience with product management. I am somewhat doubtful - because this company has a separate Product Development team (where there are actual roles called Product Manager). What this role entails is more like IT consulting and project management. I don‚Äôt see how I could truly do ‚Äúproduct management‚Äù and ‚Äúproduct strategy‚Äù as I am the intermediary user of their platform and have no say in what the core platform would look like, except how it would look like when configured right for the end users. But maybe I‚Äôm reading it wrong. Would love to hear some opinions from experienced PM who have seen the operations of similar companies. \n\nThank you!",

Here‚Äôs the situation: we are extremely thin on resources and this team handles bugs for all areas of our product. Over the past few years the bugs prioritization process has included 0 product input but the team‚Äôs work is instead based on what our head of customer experience and our head of support think should be resolved and when. This is obviously a problem for many reasons, but one of the key issues is that they do not believe in anything less than medium - everything becomes high priority and high urgency. This then skews their metrics to show there are excessive numbers of high priority issues and they are not being resolved quickly enough. Knowing I‚Äôm about to burst their bubble, I was thinking of coming up with a framework for reported bugs (MoSCoW, WSJF, etc) so that it is less ‚Äúopinion‚Äù based and there is more structure to bugs meetings vs everything being called out in a panic.

May you shed light on what holistic frameworks I should be looking at? Are there any?\n\n Should I not overanalyze this and just go with the flow &gt; Fill up a quick Lean Canvas or a BMC, identify the problem, drill behind it and interview a few customers and drill down to the real pain points, brainstorm solutions, pick one and prototype it, define the success metrics and measure, get feedback, fix, and iterate?  \n\n\nThank you guys  \n",

If you have your own list, I'd love to hear it.  If you think I suck, well, we probably won't cross paths anyway.\n\nDear potential employer,\n\nI'm writing to you today to tell you all of the reasons that you shouldn't hire me as a PM in your organization.  I'll try and keep it short, but it's a long list that you should carefully consider before we book our next meeting.\n\n1. I love customers.  I want to talk to them every chance I get, even the angry ones.\n2. I don't always get #1 right, but I'm always honest and transparent about what we're doing.\n3. I often get #1 right, and if you based my job performance on solving for the customer, I'd be retired by now.\n4. I don't think your middle managers are useful, at all.  Fire them yesterday.  I ask them for context about the business and they can't answer.  They don't know whats going on, why decisions are made, or they won't share it,, or you aren't transparent with them about what's going on and why.  If you're going to keep them see #5, but no one really seems happy with this whole arrangement.\n5. I don't want to be in repetitive weekly meetings, especially performance 1-1s.  See 4, if I have to create a 1-1 template that outlines my own \"growth and support opportunities\" because you don't know what's going on in my projects, you're wasting my time each week, and probably not effectively communicating with your own leaders about what's happening.\n6. I'm old, and I'm grumpy.  I've explained this to 900000 people before you, appoint someone else to carry the flag of justice, or, you know, just ask questions of the other 20 people you manage, find the truth in yourself and fix it.\n7. Stop making me the \"mentor\" of the group so that you can ignore the feedback in #6.\n8. I put up numbers that exceed targets, go away.\n\nSort of a tongue and cheek, but really relevant to my Q4 grump.  What are your \"don't hire me if you expect Xes?\"",

Here‚Äôs the situation: we are extremely thin on resources and this team handles bugs for all areas of our product. Over the past few years the bugs prioritization process has included 0 product input but the team‚Äôs work is instead based on what our head of customer experience and our head of support think should be resolved and when. This is obviously a problem for many reasons, but one of the key issues is that they do not believe in anything less than medium - everything becomes high priority and high urgency. This then skews their metrics to show there are excessive numbers of high priority issues and they are not being resolved quickly enough. Knowing I‚Äôm about to burst their bubble, I was thinking of coming up with a framework for reported bugs (MoSCoW, WSJF, etc) so that it is less ‚Äúopinion‚Äù based and there is more structure to bugs meetings vs everything being called out in a panic. Have any of you gone through something like this before or have any tips on slowly pulling the reins back to product and not based on Support? Any advice is welcome!",

There are valuable things in the commends of a lot of these negative posts but I think this community could benefit from talking about the positives of product management!   \n\n\nI'll start. I love that I get to work with basically the entire organization. I talk to marketing about how things should be positioned, work with post-sales as a centralized discovery channel to see where the major pain points are. Work with sales to see how we \"stack up\" against what the competition is saying. And obviously working with developers - which i find fascinating as you get to try to wrap your head around pretty complex stuff and work with some extremely bright folks in the process! I also love being creative. Whether it be talking about the general approach, how to find an approach that solves short term problems but can be iterated on to become something more complete and powerful, working with designers, etc... \n\nI LOVE my job. There are things I hate. I get pulled into 5-7 hours of meetings every day and I work 50-60 hour weeks.

      "post_content": "Recently I was approached by the recruiter from a public tech company. The company has proprietary data analytics B2B SaaS enterprise software. They market this software as the end-to-end data ecosystem that entails data ingestion, data analytics, to management fully operating using this tool. This role belongs to its Business Development team, where I need to talk to customer, figure out their needs, then customize and deploy this software for the customer. I would be paired with an engineer who does most of the technical heavy lifting, but I also need to be hands on  coding when needed. It‚Äôs framed  as a low-code tool, but from what I gathered there definitely needs to be significant amount of data pipeline building (Python) and web widget configuration (JS/TS) needed to be able to fully deploy for users. I am fluent in Python and R from previous DS job, but I definitely don‚Äôt want to be heads down coding all the time.\n\nNow the question is: My background is in consulting &amp; data science.  I am looking to pivot to product manager role. Recruiter told me this role is a perfect opportunity that combines my prior experience with product management. I am somewhat doubtful - because this company has a separate Product Development team (where there are actual roles called Product Manager). What this role entails is more like IT consulting and project management. I don‚Äôt see how I could truly do ‚Äúproduct management‚Äù and ‚Äúproduct strategy‚Äù as I am the intermediary user of their platform and have no say in what the core platform would look like, except how it would look like when configured right for the end users. But maybe I‚Äôm reading it wrong. Would love to hear some opinions from experienced PM who have seen the operations of similar companies. \n\nThank you!",

May you shed light on what holistic frameworks I should be looking at? Are there any?\n\n Should I not overanalyze this and just go with the flow &gt; Fill up a quick Lean Canvas or a BMC, identify the problem, drill behind it and interview a few customers and drill down to the real pain points, brainstorm solutions, pick one and prototype it, define the success metrics and measure, get feedback, fix, and iterate?  \n\n\nThank you guys  \n",

      "post_content": "I'm having one of those days, if you're a PM than you know... I've been thinking about other jobs,other careers, and what I really wish I could say.  If you have your own list, I'd love to hear it.  If you think I suck, well, we probably won't cross paths anyway.\n\nDear potential employer,\n\nI'm writing to you today to tell you all of the reasons that you shouldn't hire me as a PM in your organization.  I'll try and keep it short, but it's a long list that you should carefully consider before we book our next meeting.\n\n1. I love customers.  I want to talk to them every chance I get, even the angry ones.\n2. I don't always get #1 right, but I'm always honest and transparent about what we're doing.\n3. I often get #1 right, and if you based my job performance on solving for the customer, I'd be retired by now.\n4. I don't think your middle managers are useful, at all.  Fire them yesterday.  I ask them for context about the business and they can't answer.  They don't know whats going on, why decisions are made, or they won't share it,, or you aren't transparent with them about what's going on and why.  If you're going to keep them see #5, but no one really seems happy with this whole arrangement.\n5. I don't want to be in repetitive weekly meetings, especially performance 1-1s.  See 4, if I have to create a 1-1 template that outlines my own \"growth and support opportunities\" because you don't know what's going on in my projects, you're wasting my time each week, and probably not effectively communicating with your own leaders about what's happening.\n6. I'm old, and I'm grumpy.  I've explained this to 900000 people before you, appoint someone else to carry the flag of justice, or, you know, just ask questions of the other 20 people you manage, find the truth in yourself and fix it.\n7. Stop making me the \"mentor\" of the group so that you can ignore the feedback in #6.\n8. I put up numbers that exceed targets, go away.\n\nSort of a tongue and cheek, but really relevant to my Q4 grump.  What are your \"don't hire me if you expect Xes?\"",

I talk to marketing about how things should be positioned, work with post-sales as a centralized discovery channel to see where the major pain points are. Work with sales to see how we \"stack up\" against what the competition is saying. And obviously working with developers - which i find fascinating as you get to try to wrap your head around pretty complex stuff and work with some extremely bright folks in the process! I also love being creative. Whether it be talking about the general approach, how to find an approach that solves short term problems but can be iterated on to become something more complete and powerful, working with designers, etc... \n\nI LOVE my job. There are things I hate. I get pulled into 5-7 hours of meetings every day and I work 50-60 hour weeks.

      "post_content": "Recently I was approached by the recruiter from a public tech company. The company has proprietary data analytics B2B SaaS enterprise software. They market this software as the end-to-end data ecosystem that entails data ingestion, data analytics, to management fully operating using this tool. This role belongs to its Business Development team, where I need to talk to customer, figure out their needs, then customize and deploy this software for the customer. I would be paired with an engineer who does most of the technical heavy lifting, but I also need to be hands on  coding when needed. It‚Äôs framed  as a low-code tool, but from what I gathered there definitely needs to be significant amount of data pipeline building (Python) and web widget configuration (JS/TS) needed to be able to fully deploy for users. I am fluent in Python and R from previous DS job, but I definitely don‚Äôt want to be heads down coding all the time.\n\nNow the question is: My background is in consulting &amp; data science.  I am looking to pivot to product manager role. Recruiter told me this role is a perfect opportunity that combines my prior experience with product management. I am somewhat doubtful - because this company has a separate Product Development team (where there are actual roles called Product Manager). What this role entails is more like IT consulting and project management. I don‚Äôt see how I could truly do ‚Äúproduct management‚Äù and ‚Äúproduct strategy‚Äù as I am the intermediary user of their platform and have no say in what the core platform would look like, except how it would look like when configured right for the end users. But maybe I‚Äôm reading it wrong. Would love to hear some opinions from experienced PM who have seen the operations of similar companies. \n\nThank you!",

Here‚Äôs the situation: we are extremely thin on resources and this team handles bugs for all areas of our product. Over the past few years the bugs prioritization process has included 0 product input but the team‚Äôs work is instead based on what our head of customer experience and our head of support think should be resolved and when. This is obviously a problem for many reasons, but one of the key issues is that they do not believe in anything less than medium - everything becomes high priority and high urgency. This then skews their metrics to show there are excessive numbers of high priority issues and they are not being resolved quickly enough. Knowing I‚Äôm about to burst their bubble, I was thinking of coming up with a framework for reported bugs (MoSCoW, WSJF, etc) so that it is less ‚Äúopinion‚Äù based and there is more structure to bugs meetings vs everything being called out in a panic. Have any of you gone through something like this before or have any tips on slowly pulling the reins back to product and not based on Support? Any advice is welcome!",

Previously, I was a UX focused PM for the Azure Machine Learning platform. I've never undergone formal machine learning training / education.

Feel free to list and suggest anything. \n\nSome context on my job. It is a zero to low maturity org in terms of AI / ML adoption. I have the chance to drive it from the ground up in terms of a) setting up ai ml infrastructure, systems, and processes b) ai ml initiatives to improve the company's operations + increase revenue and profits and c) products and features to solve customer needs \n\nForget my past experience, think of me as a beginner and learner üôèüèº‚ô•Ô∏è",

The process with my startup was messy and there wasn't a clear \"starting point\", probably because I was an idiot back then. I‚Äôm now helping a friend with their startup and while I am asking the right questions, it feels very messy and all over the place. e.g. \"What is the customer pain?\" \"how many customers did you talk to?\" \"Let's fill up a Lean Canvas\", or \"Would going through a double diamond design thinking session give us a possible prototype to test?\"\n\nIt feels very different from being thrown in the one to N product environment. May you shed light on what holistic frameworks I should be looking at? Are there any?\n\n Should I not overanalyze this and just go with the flow &gt; Fill up a quick Lean Canvas or a BMC, identify the problem, drill behind it and interview a few customers and drill down to the real pain points, brainstorm solutions, pick one and prototype it, define the success metrics and measure, get feedback, fix, and iterate?  \n\n\nThank you guys  \n",

That way, each user can continue to use the app through their own Reddit API free access tier.\n\n(A couple of Twitter apps are already using and/or being modded to use a similar trick to remain usable. So this idea is not 100% original. But it should be useful.)",

      "post_content": "Hi all,\n\nFor my own reasons I needed a more friendly way to read the Reddit API documentation which I saved into the following pastebin (OAS compatible but endpoints and methods only): [https://pastebin.com/nQ7AuddN](https://pastebin.com/nQ7AuddN)\n\nIt doesn't contain any request details/requirements because I already have those implemented. I just wanted to add a layer that contains logging and it's annoying to make every possible endpoint by hand. Hope someone has use for it.  \nThose details are visible on [https://redit.com/dev/api](https://redit.com/dev/api) anyway so I'm assuming that's not a big deal unless you want to use the specification to validate requests before actually sending it.",

Per an [official post](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/13wshdp/api_update_continued_access_to_our_api_for/) on /r/modnews:\n\n&gt; As of July 1, 2023, we will start enforcing two different rate limits for the free access tier:\n&gt;    \n&gt; * If you are using OAuth for authentication: 100 queries per minute per OAuth client id\n&gt; * If you are not using OAuth for authentication: 10 queries per minute\n\nSo users are allowed to get free access to the Reddit API that is more than enough for one user's worth of Reddit use.\n\nAll that needs to happen at this point is for Reddit app devs to modify their apps so users can set their own API keys. That way, each user can continue to use the app through their own Reddit API free access tier.\n\n(A couple of Twitter apps are already using and/or being modded to use a similar trick to remain usable. So this idea is not 100% original. But it should be useful.)",
