I am a Product Manager at a large tech payments company and I am considering furthering my education with an MBA. My main goal with pursuing an MBA is to expand my network, particularly within the tech circle in the Bay Area. This will be my second master as I already have a T20 degree in Industrial engineering.\n\nI am currently torn between the Stanford MSx program and the Berkeley 3-year weekend program. Both programs are intensive, with the Stanford program being one year and the Berkeley program spread over three years.\n\nI have previously worked in Venture Capital and I feel an MBA could help solidify my standing in the tech industry. I am willing to invest up to $150k for this endeavor, but I am unsure which program would be the most beneficial for my career in the long term.\n\nI plan to continue my career as a Product Manager post-MBA, and I am interested in hearing your thoughts on which program might better serve my goals.\n\nThank you in advance for your advice and insights!","post_score":0,"subreddit":"ProductManagement","title":"Deciding Between Stanford MSx and Berkeley's 3-Year Weekend Program for MBA as a PM at Fintech","upvote_ratio":0.5,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/ProductManagement/comments/17xo7oh/deciding_between_stanford_msx_and_berkeleys_3year/"},{"author":"kereempuff","category":"Career Advice","contained_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/ProductManagement/comments/17xixjp/what_to_do_at_a_network_event_as_a_newbie_product/","container_sr_subscribers":134610,"created":"2023-11-17T11:30:51-05:00","name":"t3_17xixjp","num_comments":6,"post_content":"I was given the opportunity to work on this field however I am fairly new to this.

I am willing to invest up to $150k for this endeavor, but I am unsure which program would be the most beneficial for my career in the long term.\n\nI plan to continue my career as a Product Manager post-MBA, and I am interested in hearing your thoughts on which program might better serve my goals.\n\nThank you in advance for your advice and insights!","post_score":0,"subreddit":"ProductManagement","title":"Deciding Between Stanford MSx and Berkeley's 3-Year Weekend Program for MBA as a PM at Fintech","upvote_ratio":0.5,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/ProductManagement/comments/17xo7oh/deciding_between_stanford_msx_and_berkeleys_3year/"},{"author":"kereempuff","category":"Career Advice","contained_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/ProductManagement/comments/17xixjp/what_to_do_at_a_network_event_as_a_newbie_product/","container_sr_subscribers":134610,"created":"2023-11-17T11:30:51-05:00","name":"t3_17xixjp","num_comments":6,"post_content":"I was given the opportunity to work on this field however I am fairly new to this.

Additionally, it seems to not accept a limit higher than the default which returns like 75 (I can set limit to 10, but even doing 100 or 200 makes no difference)\n\nSorry if this is the wrong place for this, if it is, could you direct me to the right place?\n\nTIA!","post_score":3,"subreddit":"redditdev","title":"Searching for subreddits","upvote_ratio":0.81,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/redditdev/comments/17syixw/searching_for_subreddits/"},{"author":"LovingMyDemons","category":"General Botmanship","contained_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/redditdev/comments/17sqs2d/building_bots_whats_the_best_way_to_monitor_a/","container_sr_subscribers":73900,"created":"2023-11-11T04:12:56-05:00","name":"t3_17sqs2d","num_comments":8,"post_content":"It would be super helpful if Reddit supported web hooks, but I understand why they don't.

My resume highlights the *value I delivered* to the company/customer in every role, every bullet point. Not just what I did or what I was responsible for.\n   4. I didn't try to get a promotion - I only applied for jobs that I would be a top candidate for, \u0026amp; that I was extremely qualified for (that 3 years ago I might think I was overqualified for). Nobody is bumping up a level easily in this market.\n   5. My experience tells a story: I progressively grew in rank, as well as scope of work, also expanding into AI/ML more and more in each role.\n   6. Having 10+ YOE is huge in this market. Companies want someone who will be effective quickly - they don't want to train.\n   7. AI/ML is in high demand, so very lucky career choice I made a few years back. But I'm seeing that companies want someone who has *shipped* ML products, not just someone who has worked on a platform or only had academic experience. I had one rejection because I hadn't shipped any GenAI products specifically.\n2. **Getting decent interview success-rate**:\n   1. I launched/delivered several products \u0026amp; features, owning them throughout the full lifecycle, and my stories/answers in interviews highlighted this.\n   2. I interviewed a LOT. Every question I was asked, I wrote it down, and later used it to practice and refined my stories to have better answers in the next interview. Being good at interviewing is a skill that is fundamentally different than anything you do day-to-day as a PM.\n   3. All my stories highlighted my communication, leadership, innovation/problem solving, and they were all multi-faceted answers (e.g. they not only answered the question being asked, but they also address other common interview questions or themes).\n3. **Misc**:\n   1. LinkedIn Premium free trial was not worth it, but I did find 90% of the open roles through LI (rest were browsing company career sites). Rest of the job boards weren't that helpful at all.\n   2. I never sent a cover letter.\n   3. I did do a couple **homework** assignments, but they were relatively short and chatgpt was super helpful.\n   4. I didn't change my resume to fit the job, not even once.\n   5. Yeah, luck is a big part of it. Good luck to anyone in the same boat (laid off).\n   6. I was able to bump up my TC, but mainly due to going from private to public company, and the RSUs are worth real dollars. It's not nearly like pre-'21 where every move was a 20%-35% increase.\n   7. Trying to **time offers** was a huge pain, and nearly impossible. Back pre-recession(?) you could time everything to try to get multiple offers at once, and pick the best one. Very hard to do that now - companies all seem to be taking longer to ensure they get the perfect candidate now.\n\n**Some of the questions I got:**\n\n* Behavioral -- Tell me about a time when:\n   * ...the path forward was not clear.\n   * ...your goals weren't in alignment with another team.\n   * ...you anticipated a customer need that they didn't know they had.\n   * ...you had to make a quick decision without any supporting data.\n   * ...you had to simplify a complex problem.\n   * ...you had to coach someone who was underperforming.\n   * ...you had to perform some fact-finding to solve a problem.\n   * ...you had to dive deep into data/use a large dataset to solve a problem.\n   * ...you had to disagree and commit (this was phrased many different ways).\n   * ...you worked with a difficult stakeholder.\n   * ...you had competing priorities.\n   * ...you had to improvise.\n   * ...you had to work with multiple stakeholders who had competing priorities.\n   * ...you realized you weren't going to be able to deliver on your commitments.\n* General:\n   * Product you're most proud of.\n   * Describe in detail a technical project/product you managed.\n   * Biggest failure.\n* Product Sense:\n   * You're the PM at Spotify that introduced podcasts. What does your pitch to exec team look like?\n   * You're in charge of YouTube and you want to grow Movies, what do you do?\n   * \\+a couple others, i'll add when I remember.\n* System Design:\n   * prepped for this, but never was asked a single system design quesiton!","post_score":140,"subreddit":"ProductManagement","title":"Key Learnings from my job search - All Cold Apply (no referrals)","upvote_ratio":0.99,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/ProductManagement/comments/17wuie3/key_learnings_from_my_job_search_all_cold_apply/"},{"author":"piratedengineer","category":"Career Advice","contained_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/ProductManagement/comments/17xo7oh/deciding_between_stanford_msx_and_berkeleys_3year/","container_sr_subscribers":134610,"created":"2023-11-17T15:26:57-05:00","name":"t3_17xo7oh","num_comments":0,"post_content":"Hello fellow Redditors,\n\nI am currently facing a dilemma and would greatly appreciate your insights and experiences.

I live in a tech hub, which opened up hybrid and in-office opportunities w/o relocation (even though I was targeting remote-only roles.\n   2. While I don't have FANG(MAGMA?) experience, all of my experience is with large, globally recognizable companies.\n   3. My resume highlights the *value I delivered* to the company/customer in every role, every bullet point. Not just what I did or what I was responsible for.\n   4. I didn't try to get a promotion - I only applied for jobs that I would be a top candidate for, \u0026amp; that I was extremely qualified for (that 3 years ago I might think I was overqualified for). Nobody is bumping up a level easily in this market.\n   5. My experience tells a story: I progressively grew in rank, as well as scope of work, also expanding into AI/ML more and more in each role.\n   6. Having 10+ YOE is huge in this market. Companies want someone who will be effective quickly - they don't want to train.\n   7. AI/ML is in high demand, so very lucky career choice I made a few years back. But I'm seeing that companies want someone who has *shipped* ML products, not just someone who has worked on a platform or only had academic experience. I had one rejection because I hadn't shipped any GenAI products specifically.\n2. **Getting decent interview success-rate**:\n   1. I launched/delivered several products \u0026amp; features, owning them throughout the full lifecycle, and my stories/answers in interviews highlighted this.\n   2. I interviewed a LOT. Every question I was asked, I wrote it down, and later used it to practice and refined my stories to have better answers in the next interview. Being good at interviewing is a skill that is fundamentally different than anything you do day-to-day as a PM.\n   3. All my stories highlighted my communication, leadership, innovation/problem solving, and they were all multi-faceted answers (e.g. they not only answered the question being asked, but they also address other common interview questions or themes).\n3. **Misc**:\n   1. LinkedIn Premium free trial was not worth it, but I did find 90% of the open roles through LI (rest were browsing company career sites). Rest of the job boards weren't that helpful at all.\n   2. I never sent a cover letter.\n   3. I did do a couple **homework** assignments, but they were relatively short and chatgpt was super helpful.\n   4. I didn't change my resume to fit the job, not even once.\n   5. Yeah, luck is a big part of it. Good luck to anyone in the same boat (laid off).\n   6. I was able to bump up my TC, but mainly due to going from private to public company, and the RSUs are worth real dollars. It's not nearly like pre-'21 where every move was a 20%-35% increase.\n   7. Trying to **time offers** was a huge pain, and nearly impossible. Back pre-recession(?) you could time everything to try to get multiple offers at once, and pick the best one. Very hard to do that now - companies all seem to be taking longer to ensure they get the perfect candidate now.\n\n**Some of the questions I got:**\n\n* Behavioral -- Tell me about a time when:\n   * ...the path forward was not clear.\n   * ...your goals weren't in alignment with another team.\n   * ...you anticipated a customer need that they didn't know they had.\n   * ...you had to make a quick decision without any supporting data.\n   * ...you had to simplify a complex problem.\n   * ...you had to coach someone who was underperforming.\n   * ...you had to perform some fact-finding to solve a problem.\n   * ...you had to dive deep into data/use a large dataset to solve a problem.\n   * ...you had to disagree and commit (this was phrased many different ways).\n   * ...you worked with a difficult stakeholder.\n   * ...you had competing priorities.\n   * ...you had to improvise.\n   * ...you had to work with multiple stakeholders who had competing priorities.\n   * ...you realized you weren't going to be able to deliver on your commitments.\n* General:\n   * Product you're most proud of.\n   * Describe in detail a technical project/product you managed.\n   * Biggest failure.\n* Product Sense:\n   * You're the PM at Spotify that introduced podcasts. What does your pitch to exec team look like?\n   * You're in charge of YouTube and you want to grow Movies, what do you do?\n   * \\+a couple others, i'll add when I remember.\n* System Design:\n   * prepped for this, but never was asked a single system design quesiton!","post_score":139,"subreddit":"ProductManagement","title":"Key Learnings from my job search - All Cold Apply (no referrals)","upvote_ratio":0.99,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/ProductManagement/comments/17wuie3/key_learnings_from_my_job_search_all_cold_apply/"},{"author":"piratedengineer","category":"Career Advice","contained_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/ProductManagement/comments/17xo7oh/deciding_between_stanford_msx_and_berkeleys_3year/","container_sr_subscribers":134610,"created":"2023-11-17T15:26:57-05:00","name":"t3_17xo7oh","num_comments":0,"post_content":"Hello fellow Redditors,\n\nI am currently facing a dilemma and would greatly appreciate your insights and experiences.

I'm confident in my experience. I've led high profile product initiatives. But I'm a little shy - due to my cultural background and I'm trying to get better. I'm trying to step out of my comfort zone. Progress is super slow because I'm really experimenting a lot with what works and what doesn't. \n\nHere are my questions:\n\n1. Do I really have \u0026lt;5 years time left to end up with well-paying role and actually go up the ladder?\n2. I want to connect with good product professionals and learn, get some perspective, expand my boundaries. How do I do this if I'm not located in a tech hub? I'm not great at in-person meetups anyway. \n3. Any tips from people who have been in similar situations? \n\nThanks all!
