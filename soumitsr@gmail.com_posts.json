I keep hearing that most career growth opportunities are for people \u0026lt;40. Is it really true? If so, I want to know what to do to maximize my career growth. \n\nI've been stuck in a company that pays 60% of what other companies do. I've been a PM for 6 years.

And well, I never asked for $. Realized that too late. I've been looking for jobs in the last 2 years and it took me some time to identify my strengths and weaknesses as well as build confidence in my skills and background. I'm confident in my experience. I've led high profile product initiatives. But I'm a little shy - due to my cultural background and I'm trying to get better. I'm trying to step out of my comfort zone. Progress is super slow because I'm really experimenting a lot with what works and what doesn't. \n\nHere are my questions:\n\n1. Do I really have \u0026lt;5 years time left to end up with well-paying role and actually go up the ladder?\n2. I want to connect with good product professionals and learn, get some perspective, expand my boundaries. How do I do this if I'm not located in a tech hub? I'm not great at in-person meetups anyway. \n3. Any tips from people who have been in similar situations? \n\nThanks all!

I'm sure there is a way, so if someone could help, that would be greatly appreciated.\n\nMy PRAW attempt:\n\n    import praw\n\n\n    def search_praw():\n        reddit = praw.Reddit(client_id = my_id,\n                             client_secret = my_secret,\n                             username = my_username,\n                             password = my_password,\n                             user_agent = 'prwatutorialv1')\n    \n        df = reddit.subreddits.search(query='chickens', limit=1000)\n        for subreddit in df:\n            print(subreddit)\n\nThis gets me the list of subreddits that return with Safe Search off, but it is the subreddit name only (I also want subscriber count, and description would be nice). Additionally, it seems to not accept a limit higher than the default which returns like 75 (I can set limit to 10, but even doing 100 or 200 makes no difference)\n\nSorry if this is the wrong place for this, if it is, could you direct me to the right place?\n\nTIA!","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/redditdev/comments/17syixw/searching_for_subreddits/","created":1699721709,"upvote_ratio":0.81,"score":3,"num_comments":1,"link_flair_text":"Reddit API"},{"name":"t3_17sqs2d","Id":"17sqs2d","title":"Building bots: What's the best way to monitor a subreddit for all activity?","subreddit":"redditdev","author":"LovingMyDemons","selftext":"It would be super helpful if Reddit supported web hooks, but I understand why they don't.

I can loop it a couple times, but I'm only getting 76 results (that repeat if I keep looping it).\n\n**It looks like this is the intended behavior and there may not be a workaround.** Manually fetching each json and using the \"after\" provided or building it from the last returned record, it ends with null even though doing the search shows there are way more.\n\n==============End of edit===========\n\nI'm not an experienced dev, but I'm working on something where I want a list of related subreddits and their subscriber count and I realized that instead of manually doing a search and marking down the sub name + url + sub count, I could just use a little program to do it for me.\n\nI did try looking to see if someone had already done exactly what I wanted, but didn't find anything. I was able to piece together very nearly what I want, except that once I went to confirm the results, I realized the search was performed with \"Safe Search\" on and I can't figure out how to do it.\n\nI've learned quite a bit trying this, but right now I'm only thinking this is going to be a one off thing and was hoping I would be able to do it without practically taking a class on it lol. At this point I'm just so tired and flustered that I need a break and/or some help and guidance.\n\nIs it possible to update the search to include NSFW subreddits?\n\nHere is my code:\n\n    import os\n    import requests\n    import pandas as pd\n    \n    \n    def search():\n        search_term = \"chickens\"\n        after = \"\"  # leaving this empty gets the first 25 hot posts\n    \n        url = f\"https://www.reddit.com/search.json?q={search_term}\u0026amp;type=sr\u0026amp;after={after}\"\n        headers = {\n            \"User-Agent\": \"TestUserAgent1\",\n        }\n    \n        response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)\n        response.raise_for_status()\n        res_json = response.json()\n        json_children = res_json[\"data\"][\"children\"]\n        res = [sub['data'] for sub in json_children]\n        print(res)\n    \n        df = pd.DataFrame(res)\n        header = [\"display_name\", \"title\", \"display_name_prefixed\", \"url\", \"subscribers\", \"public_description\",\n                  \"subreddit_type\", \"quarantine\"]\n        df.to_csv('test.csv', index=False, columns=header, mode='a', header=not os.path.exists('test.csv'))\n    \n        # to page / get 25 new posts, you need to access the \"after\" field given in the response\n    \n        post_id = res_json[\"data\"][\"after\"]  # the request seems to not need the first 3 character, so they can be sliced off\n        print(post_id)\n        \n        # do some looping here to get more than 25\n        # new_response = requests.get(url, headers=headers) \n    \n    \n    if __name__ == '__main__':\n        search()\n\nLike I said, besides finishing it up to utilize the \"after\" parameter and looping to get more than just the first 25, this is working perfectly with the exception that it only returns the SFW results.\n\nI did also make an attempt using PRAW and got similarly close, but I am so blind working with it that I've gotten so frustrated over the past day that I almost would rather just make the list by hand at this point. I'm sure there is a way, so if someone could help, that would be greatly appreciated.\n\nMy PRAW attempt:\n\n    import praw\n\n\n    def search_praw():\n        reddit = praw.Reddit(client_id = my_id,\n                             client_secret = my_secret,\n                             username = my_username,\n                             password = my_password,\n                             user_agent = 'prwatutorialv1')\n    \n        df = reddit.subreddits.search(query='chickens', limit=1000)\n        for subreddit in df:\n            print(subreddit)\n\nThis gets me the list of subreddits that return with Safe Search off, but it is the subreddit name only (I also want subscriber count, and description would be nice). Additionally, it seems to not accept a limit higher than the default which returns like 75 (I can set limit to 10, but even doing 100 or 200 makes no difference)\n\nSorry if this is the wrong place for this, if it is, could you direct me to the right place?\n\nTIA!","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/redditdev/comments/17syixw/searching_for_subreddits/","created":1699721709,"upvote_ratio":0.81,"score":3,"num_comments":1,"link_flair_text":"Reddit API"},{"name":"t3_17sqs2d","Id":"17sqs2d","title":"Building bots: What's the best way to monitor a subreddit for all activity?","subreddit":"redditdev","author":"LovingMyDemons","selftext":"It would be super helpful if Reddit supported web hooks, but I understand why they don't.

I live in a tech hub, which opened up hybrid and in-office opportunities w/o relocation (even though I was targeting remote-only roles.\n   2. While I don't have FANG(MAGMA?) experience, all of my experience is with large, globally recognizable companies.\n   3. My resume highlights the *value I delivered* to the company/customer in every role, every bullet point. Not just what I did or what I was responsible for.\n   4. I didn't try to get a promotion - I only applied for jobs that I would be a top candidate for, \u0026amp; that I was extremely qualified for (that 3 years ago I might think I was overqualified for). Nobody is bumping up a level easily in this market.\n   5. My experience tells a story: I progressively grew in rank, as well as scope of work, also expanding into AI/ML more and more in each role.\n   6. Having 10+ YOE is huge in this market. Companies want someone who will be effective quickly - they don't want to train.\n   7. AI/ML is in high demand, so very lucky career choice I made a few years back. But I'm seeing that companies want someone who has *shipped* ML products, not just someone who has worked on a platform or only had academic experience. I had one rejection because I hadn't shipped any GenAI products specifically.\n2. **Getting decent interview success-rate**:\n   1. I launched/delivered several products \u0026amp; features, owning them throughout the full lifecycle, and my stories/answers in interviews highlighted this.\n   2. I interviewed a LOT. Every question I was asked, I wrote it down, and later used it to practice and refined my stories to have better answers in the next interview. Being good at interviewing is a skill that is fundamentally different than anything you do day-to-day as a PM.\n   3. All my stories highlighted my communication, leadership, innovation/problem solving, and they were all multi-faceted answers (e.g. they not only answered the question being asked, but they also address other common interview questions or themes).\n3. **Misc**:\n   1. LinkedIn Premium free trial was not worth it, but I did find 90% of the open roles through LI (rest were browsing company career sites). Rest of the job boards weren't that helpful at all.\n   2. I never sent a cover letter.\n   3. I did do a couple **homework** assignments, but they were relatively short and chatgpt was super helpful.\n   4. I didn't change my resume to fit the job, not even once.\n   5. Yeah, luck is a big part of it. Good luck to anyone in the same boat (laid off).\n   6.

I live in a tech hub, which opened up hybrid and in-office opportunities w/o relocation (even though I was targeting remote-only roles.\n   2. While I don't have FANG(MAGMA?) experience, all of my experience is with large, globally recognizable companies.\n   3. My resume highlights the *value I delivered* to the company/customer in every role, every bullet point. Not just what I did or what I was responsible for.\n   4. I didn't try to get a promotion - I only applied for jobs that I would be a top candidate for, \u0026amp; that I was extremely qualified for (that 3 years ago I might think I was overqualified for). Nobody is bumping up a level easily in this market.\n   5. My experience tells a story: I progressively grew in rank, as well as scope of work, also expanding into AI/ML more and more in each role.\n   6. Having 10+ YOE is huge in this market. Companies want someone who will be effective quickly - they don't want to train.\n   7. AI/ML is in high demand, so very lucky career choice I made a few years back. But I'm seeing that companies want someone who has *shipped* ML products, not just someone who has worked on a platform or only had academic experience. I had one rejection because I hadn't shipped any GenAI products specifically.\n2. **Getting decent interview success-rate**:\n   1. I launched/delivered several products \u0026amp; features, owning them throughout the full lifecycle, and my stories/answers in interviews highlighted this.\n   2. I interviewed a LOT. Every question I was asked, I wrote it down, and later used it to practice and refined my stories to have better answers in the next interview. Being good at interviewing is a skill that is fundamentally different than anything you do day-to-day as a PM.\n   3. All my stories highlighted my communication, leadership, innovation/problem solving, and they were all multi-faceted answers (e.g. they not only answered the question being asked, but they also address other common interview questions or themes).\n3. **Misc**:\n   1. LinkedIn Premium free trial was not worth it, but I did find 90% of the open roles through LI (rest were browsing company career sites). Rest of the job boards weren't that helpful at all.\n   2. I never sent a cover letter.\n   3. I did do a couple **homework** assignments, but they were relatively short and chatgpt was super helpful.\n   4. I didn't change my resume to fit the job, not even once.\n   5. Yeah, luck is a big part of it. Good luck to anyone in the same boat (laid off).\n   6. I was able to bump up my TC, but mainly due to going from private to public company, and the RSUs are worth real dollars. It's not nearly like pre-'21 where every move was a 20%-35% increase.\n   7. Trying to **time offers** was a huge pain, and nearly impossible. Back pre-recession(?) you could time everything to try to get multiple offers at once, and pick the best one. Very hard to do that now - companies all seem to be taking longer to ensure they get the perfect candidate now.\n\n**Some of the questions I got:**\n\n* Behavioral -- Tell me about a time when:\n   * ...the path forward was not clear.\n   * ...your goals weren't in alignment with another team.\n   * ...you anticipated a customer need that they didn't know they had.\n   * ...you had to make a quick decision without any supporting data.\n   * ...you had to simplify a complex problem.\n   * ...you had to coach someone who was underperforming.\n   * ...you had to perform some fact-finding to solve a problem.\n   * ...you had to dive deep into data/use a large dataset to solve a problem.\n   * ...you had to disagree and commit (this was phrased many different ways).\n   * ...you worked with a difficult stakeholder.\n   * ...you had competing priorities.\n   * ...you had to improvise.\n   * ...you had to work with multiple stakeholders who had competing priorities.\n   * ...you realized you weren't going to be able to deliver on your commitments.\n* General:\n   * Product you're most proud of.\n   * Describe in detail a technical project/product you managed.\n   * Biggest failure.\n* Product Sense:\n   * You're the PM at Spotify that introduced podcasts. What does your pitch to exec team look like?\n   * You're in charge of YouTube and you want to grow Movies, what do you do?\n   * \\+a couple others, i'll add when I remember.\n* System Design:\n   * prepped for this, but never was asked a single system design quesiton!","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/ProductManagement/comments/17wuie3/key_learnings_from_my_job_search_all_cold_apply/","created":1700161076,"upvote_ratio":0.99,"score":148,"num_comments":50,"link_flair_text":""},{"name":"t3_17x7duo","Id":"17x7duo","title":"Career growth after 35?
