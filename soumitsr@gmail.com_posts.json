I asked him for a coffee chat and he agreed to it in about a week from posting. This is my very first networking thing and I am very nervous. My goal is to learn from him and see first hand what being a product manager is actually like. And maybe in the future he will consider me for an internship. But really I care about just building a connection. So does anyone have any advice on the do’s and dont’s? What I can do on making a lasting impression? And how would I go about making this a recurring thing? As well if anyone can write about their first time going to a coffee chat or any type of one on one networking meeting that would be greatly appreciated.\n",

I have been doing this for a number of years but missed all the processes, rules, best practices etc.\nI know everyone will hate the idea of doing the below but I thought this could actually help lots of new PM's out there navigate the process and then pick and choose the methodologies based on where they fit in the life-cycle.\nI think the below will be a pretty big undertaking, and I am completely overwhelmed but will chip away  at it. As I am really new I am looking for some people who maybe interested in collaborating on this. I thought it could be a really useful tool to post somewhere, for companies to use, and most importantly for new PM's to just jump in and have a look.\nI would love some feedback, and even more some help. I understand it would be an investment of time. I am willing to do all the work, I just don't have the experience to write out the core process (naming each part, and them summarising) and then adding the certain methodologies to each area.\nAnyway, hopefully I don't get too roasted!\nhttps://miro.com/app/board/uXjVNNbGtCY=/?share_link_id=492716366476\n",

I've also looked at the Reddit API rate limit request documentation, in hopes that there is a method to bypass these limits.

The only difference is that this subreddit is private (the rest are public), but I don't see why that would be a problem.

Is it possible to get more than 76 results?\nPartially solved.\nI need to use \nhttps://www.reddit.com/search.json?q={search_term}&type=sr&include_over_18=on&after={after}\ninstead of\nhttps://www.reddit.com/search.json?q={search_term}&type=sr&after={after}\nNow I'm having the issue that \"after\" doesn't seem to be working as expected. I can loop it a couple times, but I'm only getting 76 results (that repeat if I keep looping it).\nIt looks like this is the intended behavior and there may not be a workaround. Manually fetching each json and using the \"after\" provided or building it from the last returned record, it ends with null even though doing the search shows there are way more.\n==============End of edit===========\nI'm not an experienced dev, but I'm working on something where I want a list of related subreddits and their subscriber count and I realized that instead of manually doing a search and marking down the sub name + url + sub count, I could just use a little program to do it for me.\nI did try looking to see if someone had already done exactly what I wanted, but didn't find anything. I was able to piece together very nearly what I want, except that once I went to confirm the results, I realized the search was performed with \"Safe Search\" on and I can't figure out how to do it.\nI've learned quite a bit trying this, but right now I'm only thinking this is going to be a one off thing and was hoping I would be able to do it without practically taking a class on it lol. At this point I'm just so tired and flustered that I need a break and/or some help and guidance.\nIs it possible to update the search to include NSFW subreddits?\nHere is my code:\nimport os\nimport requests\nimport pandas as pd\ndef search():\n    search_term = \"chickens\"\n    after = \"\"  # leaving this empty gets the first 25 hot posts\n    url = f\"https://www.reddit.com/search.json?q={search_term}&type=sr&after={after}\"\n    headers = {\n        \"User-Agent\": \"TestUserAgent1\",\n    }\n    response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)\n    response.raise_for_status()\n    res_json = response.json()\n    json_children = res_json[\"data\"][\"children\"]\n    res = [sub['data'] for sub in json_children]\n    print(res)\n    df = pd.DataFrame(res)\n    header = [\"display_name\", \"title\", \"display_name_prefixed\", \"url\", \"subscribers\", \"public_description\",\n              \"subreddit_type\", \"quarantine\"]\n    df.to_csv('test.csv', index=False, columns=header, mode='a', header=not os.path.exists('test.csv'))\n    # to page / get 25 new posts, you need to access the \"after\" field given in the response\n    post_id = res_json[\"data\"][\"after\"]  # the request seems to not need the first 3 character, so they can be sliced off\n    print(post_id)\n    # do some looping here to get more than 25\n    # new_response = requests.get(url, headers=headers) \nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    search()\nLike I said, besides finishing it up to utilize the \"after\" parameter and looping to get more than just the first 25, this is working perfectly with the exception that it only returns the SFW results.\nI did also make an attempt using PRAW and got similarly close, but I am so blind working with it that I've gotten so frustrated over the past day that I almost would rather just make the list by hand at this point. I'm sure there is a way, so if someone could help, that would be greatly appreciated.\nMy PRAW attempt:\nimport praw\ndef search_praw():\n    reddit = praw.Reddit(client_id = my_id,\n                         client_secret = my_secret,\n                         username = my_username,\n                         password = my_password,\n                         user_agent = 'prwatutorialv1')\n    df = reddit.subreddits.search(query='chickens', limit=1000)\n    for subreddit in df:\n        print(subreddit)\nThis gets me the list of subreddits that return with Safe Search off, but it is the subreddit name only (I also want subscriber count, and description would be nice). Additionally, it seems to not accept a limit higher than the default which returns like 75 (I can set limit to 10, but even doing 100 or 200 makes no difference)\nSorry if this is the wrong place for this, if it is, could you direct me to the right place?\nTIA!\n",

      "selftext_html": "I have multiple installations of the OAuth app that each make the API requests while respecting the rate limits (100 requests per minute for a 10min window).However, started getting 429s ever since the update to the rate limits in July.\nLooking at the headers that are coming back from Reddit, in particular the X-Ratelimit-Remaining which tells us how much quota is remaining, for some installations it decreases very gradually, e.g. 599, 598, 587... Which is expected - each API call is supposed to use up 1 point from the quota. Whereas for other installations I'm seeing drastic drop on each request, e.g. 487, 460, 361, 220… For context, each installation is only making 1-3 requests per second.\nCan someone confirm that the rate limit is global across all installations of the OAuth app? Are there undocumented rate limits on things like IP? Does paid API has higher rate limits?\nNot using PRAW or anything like that, just calling the free API directly.\n",

The error message is unhelpful (would be nice if it specified which subreddit is \"unavailable\") and otherwise undocumented as far as I can tell, so I'll leave this up in case somebody else runs into the same issue down the road.\nOriginal post follows:\nI'm trying to create a community list widget:\nPOST https://oauth.reddit.com/r/:subreddit/api/widget\n{\n    data: [\n        'community1',\n        'community2',\n    ],\n    kind: 'community-list',\n    shortName: 'Related Communities',\n    styles: {\n        backgroundColor: '',\n        headerColor: '',\n    }\n}\nThis is the response I'm getting:\nBad Request (400)\n{\n    \"fields\": [\n        \"subreddit\"\n    ],\n    \"explanation\": \"Subreddit is unavailable\",\n    \"message\": \"Bad Request\",\n    \"reason\": \"SUBREDDIT_UNAVAILABLE\"\n}\n...and I have no idea why.\nI've used the same API request for numerous other subreddits, and it has never happened before. The only difference is that this subreddit is private (the rest are public), but I don't see why that would be a problem. I went into Mod Tools and created the widget by hand through the UI and there was no problem.\nAny idea why this might be happening through the API?\n",

Is it possible to get more than 76 results?\nPartially solved.\nI need to use \nhttps://www.reddit.com/search.json?q={search_term}&type=sr&include_over_18=on&after={after}\ninstead of\nhttps://www.reddit.com/search.json?q={search_term}&type=sr&after={after}\nNow I'm having the issue that \"after\" doesn't seem to be working as expected. I can loop it a couple times, but I'm only getting 76 results (that repeat if I keep looping it).\nIt looks like this is the intended behavior and there may not be a workaround. Manually fetching each json and using the \"after\" provided or building it from the last returned record, it ends with null even though doing the search shows there are way more.\n==============End of edit===========\nI'm not an experienced dev, but I'm working on something where I want a list of related subreddits and their subscriber count and I realized that instead of manually doing a search and marking down the sub name + url + sub count, I could just use a little program to do it for me.\nI did try looking to see if someone had already done exactly what I wanted, but didn't find anything. I was able to piece together very nearly what I want, except that once I went to confirm the results, I realized the search was performed with \"Safe Search\" on and I can't figure out how to do it.\nI've learned quite a bit trying this, but right now I'm only thinking this is going to be a one off thing and was hoping I would be able to do it without practically taking a class on it lol. At this point I'm just so tired and flustered that I need a break and/or some help and guidance.\nIs it possible to update the search to include NSFW subreddits?\nHere is my code:\nimport os\nimport requests\nimport pandas as pd\ndef search():\n    search_term = \"chickens\"\n    after = \"\"  # leaving this empty gets the first 25 hot posts\n    url = f\"https://www.reddit.com/search.json?q={search_term}&type=sr&after={after}\"\n    headers = {\n        \"User-Agent\": \"TestUserAgent1\",\n    }\n    response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)\n    response.raise_for_status()\n    res_json = response.json()\n    json_children = res_json[\"data\"][\"children\"]\n    res = [sub['data'] for sub in json_children]\n    print(res)\n    df = pd.DataFrame(res)\n    header = [\"display_name\", \"title\", \"display_name_prefixed\", \"url\", \"subscribers\", \"public_description\",\n              \"subreddit_type\", \"quarantine\"]\n    df.to_csv('test.csv', index=False, columns=header, mode='a', header=not os.path.exists('test.csv'))\n    # to page / get 25 new posts, you need to access the \"after\" field given in the response\n    post_id = res_json[\"data\"][\"after\"]  # the request seems to not need the first 3 character, so they can be sliced off\n    print(post_id)\n    # do some looping here to get more than 25\n    # new_response = requests.get(url, headers=headers) \nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    search()\nLike I said, besides finishing it up to utilize the \"after\" parameter and looping to get more than just the first 25, this is working perfectly with the exception that it only returns the SFW results.\nI did also make an attempt using PRAW and got similarly close, but I am so blind working with it that I've gotten so frustrated over the past day that I almost would rather just make the list by hand at this point. I'm sure there is a way, so if someone could help, that would be greatly appreciated.\nMy PRAW attempt:\nimport praw\ndef search_praw():\n    reddit = praw.Reddit(client_id = my_id,\n                         client_secret = my_secret,\n                         username = my_username,\n                         password = my_password,\n                         user_agent = 'prwatutorialv1')\n    df = reddit.subreddits.search(query='chickens', limit=1000)\n    for subreddit in df:\n        print(subreddit)\nThis gets me the list of subreddits that return with Safe Search off, but it is the subreddit name only (I also want subscriber count, and description would be nice). Additionally, it seems to not accept a limit higher than the default which returns like 75 (I can set limit to 10, but even doing 100 or 200 makes no difference)\nSorry if this is the wrong place for this, if it is, could you direct me to the right place?\nTIA!\n",

I asked him for a coffee chat and he agreed to it in about a week from posting. This is my very first networking thing and I am very nervous. My goal is to learn from him and see first hand what being a product manager is actually like. And maybe in the future he will consider me for an internship. But really I care about just building a connection. So does anyone have any advice on the do’s and dont’s? What I can do on making a lasting impression? And how would I go about making this a recurring thing? As well if anyone can write about their first time going to a coffee chat or any type of one on one networking meeting that would be greatly appreciated.\n",

That way, each user can continue to use the app through their own Reddit API free access tier.\n(A couple of Twitter apps are already using and/or being modded to use a similar trick to remain usable.
